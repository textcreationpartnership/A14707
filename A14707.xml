            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And in dede me thinkes,
<pb facs="tcp:20007:5"/>
that Paule eſpied the proude abuſe of this name (Biſhoppe) before hande, wher he ſayeth: Take hede to your ſel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues, and to the hole flocke.</p>
            <p>For like as he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des flocke, that is to ſaye, the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion (or churche) to the miniſters charge: euen ſo biddeth he him alſo to beware and take hede to him ſelfe, that he ſet not his mynde vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> priuate honours and paſtimes, neclecting them that he hathe taken charge of, and ſo worke his owne deſtruction.

but chargeyng vs to miniſtre the worde faythfully, whych preſcribeth the waye and the vnfailyng rule of ſaluacion, and ther withal carieth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t paſtures of the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, wherin they fynd that meate, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che <note place="margin">

            <p>And leaſt we ſhould for any cauſe, recken the office committed vnto vs a ſmal trifling mater, he teacheth vs, how chargeable a flocke it is, that we are bounden to gouerne and fede: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the ſelfe ſame flocke, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of God hathe vouchedſafe to deliuer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with his owne blood.

For who knoweth not, that in ſafe keping of a worldlye thing, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is put in truſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, ther is ſpeciall great fidelitie and diligence required? Than how muche more faithful and diligent ought me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be in Goddes maters, and namely
<pb facs="tcp:20007:6"/>
in ſafekeping of that flocke, which the Lorde hath rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſomed with his owne blood, and layde vp in ſtoare in our cuſtodye?</p>
            <p>Nother maye we ſaye, that oure office is out of daunger, by reaſon of the preſence and ayde of him, that is the chiefe &amp; good ſhepehearde in dede, and vnder that prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe we to take the leſſe hede &amp; trauaile.

            <p>He ſaithe, wolues ſhall com, and that ſore greuous ones: whiche will not ſpare ſo worthie a flocke, ſo deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a bought flocke, ſo noble a flocke. And in an other place, wher he pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them out with more circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of wordes, he ſaithe: The ſpirite ſpeaketh euidently, that in the later dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.</note> ſom ſhall departe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faithe, and geue eare to deceaueable ſpirites and doctrines of Deuilles.

            <p>The ſame mater alſo hathe Chriſt teſtified: who, like as he ſendeth out his diſciples as ſhepe among wolues, ſo dothe he tell vs, that falſe anoynted greaſye ones, and falſe prophetes ſhal ſtarte vp (to the vndoing of a great meanye) &amp; their ſtudie ſhal be to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerte and corrupte the doctrine of the truthe.

            <p>Moreouer the heade and prince of <note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.</note> all this rable, is in an other place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared (euen the great Antichriſt him ſelfe) whiche ſhall geue the onſette vpon this ſely flocke of Chriſt thicke and three folde, bothe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> falſe forged lyes, and open tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nye of cruel wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. All whych ſayenges, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with thoſe thinges, that haue happened in our tyme, and doo daily happen ſtill, we ſhall confeſſe Chriſt to be true in his ſayeng, &amp; that Paule alſo ſpake out of the ſpirite of truthe: yea it ſhall furthermore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly appeare, who be thoſe falſe anoynted ones, and falſe prophetes, and who that myghtie houge Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:20007:7"/>
is, whome our flocke ought to beware of.</p>
            <p>Now to thintent we maye ſet our myndes conſiderately vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our office, and aſwel take hede to our ſelues, as to ſe to, and (aſmuche as lyeth in our weake nature) to prouide for the flock committed vnto our charge, we muſt nedes haue a rype knowlage of the perilles, that are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous &amp; moſt noyſome to the churche. Which, albeit they are infinite, &amp; paſt al nombre, that are dayly bluſtred vp of hym, whiche like as he walketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout as a roaring Lyon to deſtroy vs, ſo is he moſt craftie in layeng of ſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.</note> and falſe deceaueable baytes: yet we ought before al thinges, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre two maters: falſe doctrine, &amp; the griefe of the croſſe and perſecution, which are ſpeciall ſnares to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe our weakneſſe withall. For the deuil knoweth the diſpoſicion of our nature, that in diuine and heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affaires, it is wonderfull dull and drowſye, and maye very eaſely be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued: but in other cauſes (in religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpecially) it eſtemeth euery thyng ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to the ſucceſſe and ſpede, &amp; ſo it is offended at perſecution and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſite.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20007:7"/>
By reaſon wherof we ſe, that he vſeth alwaies this knacke againſt the flocke of Chriſt, that either he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth the ſimple ſorte with falſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Yf any man wolde require exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples herof, he ſhal mete them ſo thick, that he ſhall not nede to take muche paine in ſearching of them. For the deueliſhe dreames of the Nazarenes maye ſtande for an example, whiche iomble the lawe and Chriſt together, and make his merite of none effecte. And whan thoſe dreames were euen ſcarcely repreſſed, ther was perſecuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on done by that monſtre of nature. <hi>Nero.</hi> Hervnto we maye make reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> and his ſucceſſour (that prodigious ſlaue of lechery, pryde, &amp; crueltie) <hi>Domitianus.</hi> Among theſe we wil recke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Arrius,</hi> and the tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes that folowed his heretical madneſſe.</p>
            <p>And lyke as the nerer we drawe to thende of the world, ſo muche y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more pernicious and more perilous is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing: ſo in our tyme we ſee that

myghtye houge Antichriſt (the biſhop of Rome) farre excede al his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours in tyranny, and ſo outragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raue wyth bothe theſe ſweordes, that a man can not wel diſcerne, with whether he dothe hurte the churche <note place="margin">The ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Popes doctrine.</note> the ſorer. For he hath brought in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that is cleane contrarie repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt to the true doctrine. For it dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth men from God, &amp; maketh them to ſerue creatures: it teacheth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſeke ſaluacion in their owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, and to truſt in their owne ſtrenghtes.</p>
            <p>He hath alſo forged ſuche a kynde of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as hath more twitle twat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le toyes in it, then the Leuitical lawe, and al the ſuperſticion that euer the gentiles vſed. Yea it is patched toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with parte of both of them, and is moſt farre of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpirite &amp; truthe. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.</note> And yet vnder pretenſe of this religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is aduaunced to ſo highe power and tyranny, that he is hable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them that repyne againſt it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them that ſpeake againſt it, &amp; to kil and ſlea them that reſiſte, &amp; can not beleue it.</p>
            <p>Therfore the lyeng ſpirite of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour playeth the deuil in the churche
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20007:8"/>
at this daye, and the Biſhop of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nical ſwoord layeth on load withal, and that not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons now as in tymes paſt long ago, but vpon moſt myghtye Princes, the moſt famous cyties: yea vpon al ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of people his ſweorde is drawen, &amp; maketh ſtreames of blood to renne downe euery where. For now we ſee great cities take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and throwe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe, fieldes laide waſte, honeſt weme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and mayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s defiled with abominable le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, and yong babes alſo either kil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led, or elles (which is the more horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) maymed of their limmes. We ſe the flowre of youthe brought to the horrible wyckedneſſe of buggery, and al hole Germany in the meane ſpace euery where cruelly vexed. And albeit that choſen inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Satan (An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt) rage with open tyranny, yet (by ioynyng lyes to his tyranny) his drift is to cloke his deuilliſhe attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, and the occaſions therof, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueagle the vnlearned and ſimpler ſorte with falſe forged cauſes, &amp; craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to cauſe many folkes, to hate the truthe of the Goſpel &amp; true religion.</p>
            <p>Let vs awake therfore (brethren) &amp; ſeing we are placed in the watche
<pb facs="tcp:20007:9"/>
towre, let vs reproue the ſweorde, not that is yet commyng, but preſently come, and layeth on loade, yea and batheth it ſelf all ready in the bowel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of the flocke. For in this caſe ther is many a mannes faithe aſſayed. Ther be ſom, whych bicauſe they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue not the feate of forgeing of lies, are ſone begyled.</p>
            <p>Ther be ſome which bicauſe they can not diſcerne the true doctrine &amp; ymagined ſuperſticio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſondre, take falſhead for truthe.

And ſom ther be alſo, which are ſo offended, whan the croſſe and heate of perſecucion co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that after that triall, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maye plainly perceaue, they receaued the ſede of the Goſpell in to ſtonye grounde.</p>
            <p>In this caſe therfore, is our dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cure required, good brethren. In this behalfe it ſtandeth vs neceſſarily in hande, to ſhewe our ſelues faithful watchemen, ſo as the people being warned by vs, maye be hable to kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we falſe fained doctrine, to beware of forged ſuperſticion, to ſhonne the

baites &amp; ſnares of lies, and in no wiſe to be offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perſecucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cometh.</p>
            <p>And principally it ſhal be our parte to geue the onſette vpon the autour of ſo haynous a miſchief (the biſhop of Rome) whom not only the prophetes, but alſo Chriſt and thapoſtles (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the hiſtories) directly proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, to be the right &amp; mightie houge Antichriſt.

            <p>And againſt forged ſuperſticion &amp; lyeng doctrines, ther is (doutles) no preſenter a remedye, than to knowe the truthe. For where the lyght of the truthe ſpreadeth out his beames, ther maye the deuil put vp his pypes, for any hurt he can do, with his darke dongeon of lyes.</p>
            <p>As for the talkes of ſome fyne fyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gred te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drelinges, they are not worth the hearing: which bycauſe they are afrayde of their owne carcaſſe and pelfe, wolde in no wiſe haue an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye

            <p>I beſeche you (good brethren &amp; fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe curates) beare wyth me, though I anſwer theſe men playnly home at fewe wordes. For I coulde eaſily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne their prittle prattle talking, if ther were not ſom of their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that loke to be reported not only for fanonrers of the goſpelles truthe, but euen doctours alſo, and that not of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſorte of doctours. Who foraſmuche as they wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like this worke, which I purpoſe to ſet furthe, can not fantaſye all thoſe paynes that men take, in ſpeaking &amp; doyng againſt the Biſhop of Romes tyrannye. And yet for al that, theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me fyne carpet doctours make them ſelues wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous buſye and earneſt, in dryuyng awaye a ſorte of lowſye harlot Friers, and maungie Maſſe-prieſtes. In this they thinke they do

gaily. And yf they chaunce at auentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to hitte vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a newe terme of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, to floute and taunt thoſe vngraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtres withal, Lorde, ſo bragge they are of it. But yet they wolde not haue the head &amp; chief prince of theſe monſtres to be meddled againſt, in no wiſe.</p>
            <p>But I wolde haue them to anſwer me. Doo you thinke it to be true (O you ſaweye, &amp; more than arrogaunt frierly diuinitie doters) that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Paule, yea that God him ſelf hathe ordained you to be watchemen in his houſe? Sure you will ſaye, it is true, for you can not denye it onles ye will loſe all the glorie of your eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macion, which ye ſet ſo muche by.</p>
            <p>Than what thinke you is the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a watchema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Is it ynough for him to tang the watchebell, whan a raſcall common ſouldiour (or twoo) of the enemies bande cometh, &amp; whan the chieftayn of the Armye, and high Emperour him ſelfe approcheth with his hole hooſt, to make no ſigne at al? I thinke you wil not graunt that.</p>
            <p>But than chiefly ſhoulde the trompet ſounde, than ſhould he ring alarme moſt of al, than muſt the cytezins be

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to harneſſe ſpecially: tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the greateſt daungier of all other. And except the watcheman doo thus, he ſhall not only be called a necligent cowheardly wretche, but alſo a falſe knaue, and a traitour to the common wealthe.</p>
            <p>What a madneſſe is it than (in the deuilles name) for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to thinke that neceſſarily requiſite, in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtracion of the churche, which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not only profitable, but alſo of neceſſitie to be done in the temporal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealthe? And I pray you, what weapones are they, that Antichriſt dothe moſt hurte and villanye with all? euen lies and craftye deceate are the thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, that he ſetteth him ſelf out moſt with all. Bicauſe he is furniſhed with a falſe title, he reigneth in many mennes hartes, whoſe ignoraunt blindneſſe and ſimplicitie he abuſeth, to eſtabliſhe his tyrannye. Shall we than ſuffre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be ſeduced through ignoraunce ſtill, ſeing it lieth in vs, to deliuer them at ones, from that ſo haynous a tyrannye, by the light of the truthe?

vſe is to do more hurt with flatterie, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> furye? That may not be, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.

            <p>Concerning his diſpleaſures, we ought not to be afraide of them, nor adradde of his thonder clappes. As for <note place="margin">

            <p>Now being moued by theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones, I haue taken vpon me this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour (not being ignoraunt what dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And this ſame worke (louing brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; felowe miniſters) I thought good to dedicate vnto you: not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> I thought my ſelf hable, being a yong man, to inſtructe myne au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cientes: being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned my ſelfe, to teache my betters in learnyng: and being a yongling

and barbarous my ſelfe, to informe men of moſt famous eloquence, with theſe my dooinges: but that my myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de was to rendre a playne rekonyng of my ſtudies vnto thoſe men, whom I ſawe trauaile this many yeares (lyke hartie and conſtaunt faythfull men) in this matter, and dyd muche good w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>al. And ſo I thought it not vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>profitable, that this doctrine ſhoulde openly come to lyght, beyng ſet furth vnder the publike priuilege of al you, ſeyng it is neceſſary, principally in this ſorowful tyme of affliction.</p>
            <p>But before I make an ende of my tale, I thinke good to ſpeake a lytell co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Antichriſtes other ſweord (that is, his open tyrannye) that men may the more eaſely vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, what is the occaſion of the croſſe and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cucion, and that we ought paciently to beare it.</p>
            <p>But furſt of al, it is to be enquired by whoſe counſaile, mocion or ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it is, that Chriſtes churche ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of the ſmarte of the croſſe. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, that doo we learne of the only and vndeniable ſcholemaiſter of the world, which hathe ben in the fathers boſome from euerlaſting, &amp; therfore
<pb facs="tcp:20007:13"/>
ſeyng he knoweth al ſecretes, he hath opened them vnto vs, as farre as it is lawful &amp; profitable for vs to know. Whan he ſent furthe his diſciples to preache the Goſpel, after that he hade talked muche concerning the croſſe &amp; perſecucions, at laſte he ſayeth thus: Are not two ſparowes ſolde for a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? And yet not one of them falleth <note place="margin">

            <p>In theſe wordes nowe, the Lorde ſheweth vs the principall cauſe of the croſſe: that what ſo euer it is, that the godly are wont to haue chaunce vnto them, it cometh by the will &amp; decreed cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſail of his father. For although it is not the knowyng of Goddes wil, that ſetteth thoſe that be perſecutours on worke, but the luſte of their owne priuate affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hate, malice, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pight of Goddes worde: yea and albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it Satan (the father of all murther &amp; violence) ſtere them vp: yet none of al theſe haue any power, ſtrengthe or force againſt Chriſtes churche, except the Lorde hym ſelfe ſuffre them to

            <p>The worde of the goſpell hathe (by the fauourable grace of God) ben re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed and preached to the people of Germanye, now about fyue &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares and more.

            <p>Our Lorde &amp; ſaueour Ieſus Chriſt, as his diſciples behelde the mightie &amp; noble building of the temple of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, ſaide vnto them: See you all theſe thinges? verily I ſaye vnto you, ther ſhall not one ſtone be left vpon an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other, that ſhall not be deſtroyde. And wyth theſe wordes of Chriſt his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were excedingly amaſed. And where as according to the cuſtome of their auncettours and of their owne tyme, they hade as yet the buſye and gliſtering gaye ceremonies of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde woriſhipping (that in tymes paſt were ſet furthe by Moſes lawe) in great price, and euen ſo eſtemed them worthy to be honoured and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued; wyth a certain deuocion of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the tyme that they came al one vnto him, whan he taried alone in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, they deſyred him to ſolute vnto them three queſtiones, which they propounded vnto him.

Secondarily, wher in the ende of the 23. Chaptre (after he hade ſo ſore que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reled wyth the ſcribes &amp; chief rulers of the Iewes) he made me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cion of his laſt commyng: they queſtioned therof wyth him alſo, and of the deſpeching of all the hole worlde, whan it ſhoulde be.

            <p>To theſe three queſtiones (ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the Lorde maketh anſwere in this chaptre. And wher as he being a truſty teacher of thoſe that his are, dothe truly teache thoſe thinges, that only ſerue vnto our ſaluacion, he talketh nothing in this place of the appointment of the tymes, ne yet ſheweth what yeare, moneth, or daye theſe thinges ſhall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce: that is to wete, bicauſe the certainly perceaued knowlage

But he inſtructeth them wyth euident and vnfailing ſignes, by token wherof they might clearely diſcerne, that theſe thinges ſhall aſſuredly com to paſſe, and alſo he teaceth them, whether they ſhall ſhortly com to paſſe.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuche as Chriſt the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, is the vniuerſall teacher of all the worlde vniuerſally, we ſhall not recke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that theſe tokens were geuen to non other, but to the Apoſtles alone: for it is manifeſt, that they were geuen no leſſe to vs, than vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to thintent vndoubtedly, that we ſhoulde be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently occupied in the conſideration of them, and that whan we ſee them happen, we ſhoulde ſhake of all drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of our myndes, and (like faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hearty ſeruauntes) loke for the commyng of our Lorde.

For like as the Lorde God in tymes paſt, choſed the people of Iſrael to him ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, peculiarly out of all other nacio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and people, and coupled them to him ſelf with a moſt holy ſacred co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt: euen ſo was it his will, that the ſame people ſhoulde be an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to al other, wher into (as in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon glaſſe) all people ſhoulde loke.

            <p>Wherfore to thintent the maters that make to this purpoſe, maye the more clearely and ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly appeare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, it ſemeth, that before we goo to the mater it ſelfe, we muſt weighe three thinges.

Thirdly what is written vnto vs in the holy

ſcriptures, concerning Antichriſt, &amp; what is neceſſaire for vs to thinke, &amp; beleue of him.</p>
            <p>That Antichriſt ſhall riſe vp in <note place="margin">whether ther be Antichriſt</note> the laſt tymes of this worlde, before the laſt &amp; glorious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng of Chriſt to iudgement, it is written wyth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient teſtimonie, in the kokes bothe of the olde teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and of the newe. For the Prophet of God Eſaie in the 11.

In which place, by this word (wycked one) is not to be vnderſtanden euery ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie and enemie of God, but that notable and great enemye of God, euen Antichriſte: that he (as the chief head of moſt highe wickedneſſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to his excellencie) maye be called the wicked one.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20007:27"/>
the 10.

To this purpoſe alſo maketh the godly Prophet Ezechiel, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezech.</hi> 38. <hi>and.</hi> 39.</note> which by Gog and Magog, dothe (in fygure) pretily ſet furthe the ymage of Antichriſt. Beſides theſe the moſt noble Prophet and moſt hartily deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous man Daniel in the 7. and 11. Chap. telleth all the buſyneſſe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, wyth ſuche playneſſe of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cripcion, that he might ſeme not to prophecie of thinges to come, but to write a ſtory of a mater all readye done. In like caſe alſo, Zacharie the Prophet in the 11. Chap. maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of the ſame mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtre, wher he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of a certain foliſhe paſtor, and an Idole rather than a Paſtor, that ſhoulde be moſt farre of from all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a true Paſtor. And if we goo to the bokes of the newe teſtament, we ſhall muche more euidently and more perfitely ſee this mater, as we ſhall all other maters alſo. For he that is the Lorde him ſelf, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
<pb facs="tcp:20007:28"/>
teacher of the truthe Ieſus Chriſt, nameth here falſe Chriſtes: and deſcribeth them yet more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the ende of the Chaptre. And the diſciple whom Chriſt our ſaueour loued, vſed the very ſelf worde Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſte, in his furſt epiſtle, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chap. writing on this maner. Babes, now is the laſt tyme, and as you haue hearde, that Antichriſt ſhall com, ther begynne many Antichriſtes, to be euen now allready. Furthermore in his holy ſacred apocalipſe, which he receaued by the reuelacion of Chriſt, he expreſſeth all Antichriſtes buſyneſſe, wyth ſuch ſtudie and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that he ſheweth the ſpringing and furſt begynnynges of this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked one, his procedinges, his power, his ſtreinghtes, his ſubtilties, his doinges, his ende and deſtruction, and alſo ſheweth his tyme and place (by name, in a maner) and pointeth them, as it were wyth his fyngre.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing dothe Paule alſo that great Apoſtle of Chriſt, 2. <hi>Theſſa.</hi> 2. Finally to the ſame ende, ought the ſayenges alſo to be applied, that are written. 1, <hi>Tim,</hi> 4. and .2. <hi>Pe.</hi> 2. and in

many other places, wherin all the hole garde of Antichriſt, that is to ſaye, all the rable of falſe Prophetes is in moſt ample wiſe painted out, in their owne colours. Therfore we muſt in no wiſe doubt, of the ryſing &amp; tyrannie of Antichriſt, but rather watche &amp; geue moſt diligent waiting attendaunce, whether now (ſeing he is ſtrate vp) he practice y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame his tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Moreouer, that other thing which we propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the ſeconde place, is here moſt chiefly neceſſarie to be <note place="margin">what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt is.</note> knowne, to thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ntent we may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, what Antichriſt is: wherin we ſhall perceaue the blyndeneſſe of mankynde, and the working wyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Sathan, wherwyth he hathe made vs ſuche Dawepoopies, that we haue ſerued Antichriſt with al kin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of diligent ſeruices, and yet we were not hable to knowe him.</p>
            <p>Howbeit all this gaire, the moſt wyly craftes man hathe (after his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed maner) by the darkeneſſe of lies, brought to paſſe.

were moſt fitte to deceaue, haue (by the inſtincte of Sathan) added many other thinges to w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>all. For like (ſaye they) as he ſhal be brought furthe in to light, in his playne deuilliſhe concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and natiuitie, ſo ſhall he alſo be ſtreinghtned continually with ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of magical philoſophers, inchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Theſe (I ſaye, welbeloued brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Chriſt) are Satanes forged fables of Antichriſt, which that wicked craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes maiſter of lyes, hath decked &amp; gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed euen w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> teſtimonies of ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, to thinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vndoubtedly, that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaued a falſe ymaginacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; loke an other way, he myght be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the meane tyme; to ſtere vp the

For thys ſame cauſe therfore, his drift was, to declare him to be among the infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate people of Iewes, and to ſende a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade the ymaginacions of our wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes out to Babilon, and than to make muche pryttle pratle of Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (which after the vndeniable ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Chriſt our Lorde, ſhall neuer be poſſible to be buylded vp agayne) to the intent in the meane while, he ſhoulde not once come in our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that hath exalted his heade at Rome, in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp; beyng (with ſuche abominable ſaucy entrepriſe) exalted euen againſt the Lorde hymſelfe, hathe infected the ſimple &amp; rude mennes myndes wyth moſt greuous errours.

               <pb facs="tcp:20007:31"/>
               <hi>Antichriſtus</hi> is a Greke worde, and being compounded of <hi>Anti,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth contrarietie and ouerthwarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and <hi>Chriſtus,</hi> wherof we haue ſpoken before, betokeneth him that is contrarie &amp; againſt the Lorde Chriſt, and chalengeth to him ſelfe, by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſte title and wicked arrogauncie, the honour, glorie, and al offices elles, whiche are due to none, but to Chriſt our ſaueour. Wherupon Paule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the mater rather than the name, calleth him <hi>Antikeimenon,</hi> bicauſe he ſytteth in the temple of God, and exalteth him ſelfe aboue all that is worſhipped, in the ſtede of God.

            <p>To be brief, inaſmuche as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of Antichriſt ſoundeth contrarie and againſt Chriſt, it behoueth vs furſt of al to know &amp; acknowlage our lorde &amp; ſaueour Chriſt, with al thoſe

            <p>Now than as touching Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the holy ſcriptures paynt and ſet him out vnto vs of ſuch ſorte, as him that being from euerlaſting verye God (and of all one eſſence and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce with his heauenly father) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke vpon him for our ſakes (at the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes appointed) the very fleſhe and nature of man, being like vnto ours in all thinges, ſynne excepte, to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he might be our chief hygh biſhop: Whoſe office he hathe ſo accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, that in offring him ſelfe on the altare of the croſſe, he made oblation vnto God the heauenly father, with a perfite and a ſufficient ſacrifice for the ſynnes of al the worlde. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hade fyniſhed the buſyneſſe of our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the altare of the croſſe, he was buried, &amp; by his owne diuine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer he raiſed vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deathe his body, that is to wete, the very manhead, which he hade taken, to thintent he might breake &amp; put quyte awaye the power of deathe, which it hade ouer
<pb facs="tcp:20007:32"/>
vs. Than after warde he caried his body in to the heauens, that he might ſet open vnto vs again the gates of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which the tranſgreſſion of our furſt parent, and the ſynnes of vs all, hade ſhutte vp before: and that he might there appeare before God the father, a faithful aduocate and media<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tour for vs, and might alſo be in ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of a pledge and a gage, wherby our faithe ſhoulde be confirmed, wherby alſo we beleue, that our bodies ſhall (through faithe) haue poſſeſſion in the very ſame kyngdome of heauens, &amp; euerlaſting bleſſedneſſe. For which cauſes ſake, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcripture is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed, to name the ſelf ſame Chriſt: our head, our highe prieſt, our kyng, our ſaueour, our redemour, our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, and euen the one only waye of life and euerlaſting ſaluacion, which the ſcripture alſo dothe make good, with moſt abundaunt teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as muche as we haue now ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. For Paule the apoſtle writing to his Philippianes, in the 2. Chap. ſaithe thus: Chriſt Ieſus whan he was in the ſhape of God (that is to ſaye, very God) thought it no robberie
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20007:32"/>
to be equall with God: neuertheles he made him ſelf of no reputacion, taking on him the ſhape of a ſeruaunt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came like vnto men, and was founde in his apparail as a man (that is to ſaye, a very man, made like vnto vs in all thinges, ſynne except) he humbled him ſelf, and became obedient vnto deathe, euen the deathe of the croſſe. Again in his furſt epiſtle to Timothee the. 1. Chap. Chriſt Ieſus (<expan>
                  <am>

               </expan> he) came in to the worlde to ſaue ſynners, of whom I am chief. &amp;c. And in an other place <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. he writeth on this wiſe: As it is appointed vnto all men, that they ſhall once dye, and than cometh iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, euen ſo was Chriſt once offred, to take away the ſynnes of many, &amp; vnto them that loke for him, ſhall he appeare againe without ſynne, vnto ſaluacion. And a lytel before theſe wordes, we reade that the ſame Apoſtle wrote on this maner: For Chriſt is not entred into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy places, that are made with ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des (which are ſimilitudes &amp; exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of true thynges) but is entred into very heauen, for to appeare now in the ſyght of God for vs, not to offre hym ſelfe often, as the hygh Prieſt entred

But now in thende of the worlde hath he appeared once, to put ſynne to flight by the offring vp of him ſelfe. All thoſe ſayenges belong alſo to this purpoſe, wich the apoſtles ſpeake of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, in this meanyng: as theſe be, Chriſt is of God made vnto vs wiſdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemption. 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 1.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20007:33"/>
once and efteſones frome heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng: This is my welbeloued ſonne, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I am pleaſed. <hi>Math.</hi> 13. &amp;. 17. chap.

Concerning this glory and honour he ſaithe, and profeſſeth, that he will geue it to none elles.

The ſeconde is the kingdome of the Perſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to ſo highe power of their moſt victorious king Cyrus, that it wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne the monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie &amp; Empire of all the worlde.

            <p>The thrid kingdome, is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Macedonians or Grekes: the furſt autor wherof (we reade) was Alexandre the great. This kingdome the holy gooſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pareth to the Leopar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, that hade foure winges, and was harneſſed wyth as many hornes. Hereby is noted the wylie, ſubtil, and craftye natural witte of the people of the grekes, which wrought their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters almoſt wyth ſubtilties &amp; wyles, like the Leoparde, which is an exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wylie beaſt. The wynges alſo betoken that notable peerles celeritie of Alexandre the great: who wythin a fewe yeares ſpace wyth his ſtering of warres, went cleane ouer Aſia and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrike, and ſubdued them vnder his owne dominion. But this leoparde is in ſight armed wyth foure hornes, forſomuche as after the deathe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander the great, the hole Empire was diuided of his owne me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (whom

            <p>The fourthe kingdome is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Romaynes, which for victorious ſtreynght, vnſhrynking courage, ſhameles audacitie, power, crueltie and moſt merciles tyrannye, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to a newe and vnknowne beaſt, that hathe no certayn name. For it is manifeſt, that the people of the Romaynes, being moſt gredye of Empire and large autoritie, occupied all the kingdomes of the worlde, dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the coaſtes of their empire farre and broade, deuoured all regiones w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their inſaciable gredyneſſe, brought all naciones and people in ſubiection, gathered all the ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; richeſſe of the hole world in to their owne citie, and trode, tare and ſtroyed all nacio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vnder the cruell fete of their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicion. In theſe mennes empire and monarchie, Daniel deſcribeth all the myſterie of Antichriſt in theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: This beaſt hade te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hornes, wherof I toke good hede. And beholde, ther growed out an other litle horne among
<pb facs="tcp:20007:38"/>
them, before who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> three of the furſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes were broken, &amp; plucked awaye. And behold, ther were hornes in this horne, lyke the eyes of a man, &amp; a mouth ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king preſumptuous thinges, &amp; ſemed more ſtoute tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other. Which horne alſo (whan I loked on) made bataile with the ſaintes, and preuailed againſt them: vntil the olde aged came, &amp; iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement was geuen to the ſaintes on hye, &amp; til the appointed time was come, that the ſaintes ſhoulde haue the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Al theſe thinges (I ſay) Daniel was taught in viſion, concerning the myſteries of Antichriſt, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame, which he himſelf learned of the Angell, and deſcribeth here after in theſe wordes. The fourth beaſt ſignifieth the fourth Kyngdome, that ſhal be in the worlde, which muſt diffre from al kingdomes, and deuour all the earthe, &amp; breake &amp; al to barſte it. And the ten hornes betoken that out of it, ten Kynges ſhal ryſe, and after them ther ſhall ryſe an other, diffring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the farther, which ſhall oppreſſe &amp; throwe downe three kynges. Be ſhall alſo talke of diuine maters: but he ſhal trappe the holy ſaintes, &amp; ſhal chalenge to him ſelf
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20007:38"/>
to chaunge the ſtate of tymes &amp; lawes, which ſhal be deliuered vnto his auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, whether it be a long ſpace of tyme or a ſhorte. Finally the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is ſet, &amp; they haue taken his dominion from him, that he maye be vtterly waſted and deſtroyed. But to the people of the holy ſaintes ſhal be delyuered the kingdome, and dominion, and largeneſſe of kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, vnder al the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; their kyng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome is an euerlaſting kyngdome, &amp; all high aſtates ſhal ſerue and obey him.</p>
            <p>This verely is the interpretacion of the viſion, which was geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel by the Angel, &amp; teacheth by ſome certayn vnfallible markes, that by this litell horne the great aduerſarie of our ſaueour Chriſt (euen Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt) is repreſented. For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete ſayeth, that he ſhal moue batayl againſt the ſaintes: that is to ſaye, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the faythfulles, whome Chriſt hath ſanctified with his owne blood. Beſides this, that he ſhal ſpeake pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous thinges, and that wyth ſuche an inſolencie, that he ſhall alſo entremeddle communicacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of diuine maters. And yet it ſufficeth not him, to haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, but he muſt
<pb facs="tcp:20007:39"/>
alſo take vpon hym power, to chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the ſtate and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicions of tymes, and of al maters of this worlde, yea &amp; the lawe it ſelfe, and the ordinaunces at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>All which thinges can ryghtly be aſcribed vnto none other, but to that myghtie and famous aduerſarie of Chriſt our Lorde, Antichriſt I meane. But of this we ſhall more largely and more plainly ſpeake, in the treatiſe folowyng.</p>
            <p>Nowe ther is that other place of this treatiſe behinde, which I promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to bringe furthe of the Apoſtle Paule: which with more cleare wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, expoundeth the greater parte of this viſion, in the later Epiſtle to his Theſſalonians, in the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de chaptre, For where as the Theſſalonians (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng diſquieted through falſe doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of certain deceauours) thought, that the laſt daye of iudgement, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng of our Lorde Ieſu Chriſt drewe nere, and was than already at hande: Paule a faythfull doctour of thoſe that were his, confuteth the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely conceaued opinion, touching that mater, with theſe maner of wordes &amp;

reaſones. Let no man deceaue you by any meanes. For the Lorde ſhall not come, except ther com a departi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g furſt, and: that the man of ſynne be opened, the ſonne of perdicion, which is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie: and is exalted aboue all that is called God, or is wourſhipped, ſo that he dothe ſytte in the temple of God as God, boaſting him ſelfe to be God. Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>membre ye not, that whan I was yet wyth you, I tolde you theſe thinges? And now ye knowe what wythholdeth: euen that he might be vttred at his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. For the myſterie of the iniquitie dothe allready worke, till he which now only letteth, be taken out of the waye. And tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall that wicked one be vttred, whom the Lorde ſhall conſume wyth the ſpirite of his mouthe, and ſhall deſtroye wyth the appearaunce of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng: euen him whoſe commyng is after the working of ſathan, wyth all lyeng po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, ſignes and wondres, and wyth all deceaueableneſſe of vnrighteouſneſſe, among them that periſhe: bicauſe they receaued not the loue of the truthe, that they might be ſaued. And therfore God ſhall ſende them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhoulde beleue lyes: that all they
<pb facs="tcp:20007:40"/>
might be demned, which beleued not the truthe, but hade pleaſure in vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Thus farre haue I rehearſed Paule thapoſtles wordes, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyne the ful &amp; perfyt deſcripcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al this adoo, and of the myſteries of Antichriſt: &amp; alſo the playne interpretacion of the viſion, that is recorded in Daniel the Prophete.

            <p>But out of theſe maters, which are thus farre already ſayde (welbeloued brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Chriſt) this we muſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, that accordyng to the oracles of goddes worde, and of Ieſu Chriſt, An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhall ſurely come, which by his falſe prophetes ſhal ſeduce an infinite multitude of people.</p>
            <p>We muſt therfore (brethren) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour our ſelues, with moſt earneſt ſtudie and diligence, that furſt of all, we maye be throughly perfyte in the certain true knowlage of our Lorde &amp; only ſaueour Ieſu Chriſt: wherin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng

            <p>Therfore we hade nede diligently to conſider the wordes of God, and to call vpon him alſo diligently, with continuall prayers, that he wolde voucheſafe to open vnto vs the true vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of his worde, &amp; to leade vs in to the true knowlage of his ſonne our redemour: and that we be not deceaued with Antichriſtes lyes, but continue ſtedfaſtly in Chriſt our ſaueour, which is the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting veritie.

Howbeit as ſone as they are riſen vp, he ſaithe that Antichriſt ſhoulde growe vp alſo, which (euen
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20007:46"/>
at the furſt begynnyng of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) ſhoulde oppreſſe three kinges, and with their ſtreingthes and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, (which he ſhal chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge to him ſelf) ſhoulde confirme his owne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Hereunto the ſayenges of Paule agree in euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which ſayeth, that a Departing ſhall com furſt, and than the man of ſynne, the childe of perdicion ſhal be reuealed.

For in dede Antichriſt coulde not chalege to him ſelf, the Dominion of the citie of Rome, nor reigne in it, as long as the empire yet floriſhed and increaced his power. And for that cauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete Daniel maketh mencion, that
<pb facs="tcp:20007:47"/>
the empire of Rome muſt be diuided in to ten (that is to ſaye, many) king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.

Than whan the empire of Rome (throughe ſuche ſciſmes and departinges) ſhronke in to decay, Antichriſt hade occaſion and place, to burſt out in to the ſame his Empire.

This man was the furſt (I ſaye) that ordayned the Biſhop of Rome to be head of the churche, and graunted to thoſe ambicious and inſolent Biſhoppes of Rome, the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous power that they hade long wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for.</p>

And ther wanted not at that tyme ſignes and wondres, wherby the heauenly father admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed wretched mortal folkes, of the periles which ſhoulde be brought in by Antichriſt.

            <p>By theſe tokens it was vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the father of heauens will, to ſhewe vnto all men, that Antichriſtes fire began allready to burne in Italie, which (wyth a ſore burnyng flame) ſhould conſume and diſquiete the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of many men.</p>
            <p>For euen at the furſt, whan the Biſhop of Rome was aduaunced to ſo highe power, ther paſt ſcarcely fourtie yeares, but he beganne to ſet out all his ſtreinghtes and autoritie, againſt the very Emperours them ſelues, not wythout their greuous ſore damage and perile. For in the yeare of our ſaueour Chriſtes birthe DCCxij. Philippicus the Emperour of the Monothelites, was infecte wyth the hereſie of them, which holde opinion, that ther is but one only wil in Chriſt Ieſu. By reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof pope Conſtantine ſtryketh him wyth the <note place="margin">Striuing about ymages.</note> thonderbolt of his curſe, and maketh this decree and ſtatute wythall, that the ymages of the holy fathers, which

            <p>But wher as the moſt parte folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the Monothelites hereſie, they were alſo ouercome and ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, from this godly and holy ſentence of aboliſhing of ymages: &amp; ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vſe of ymages being confirmed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhop <note place="margin">Emperour Leo the third ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ymages.</note> of Romes autoritie, brought a newe parte of ſuperſticio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in to the churche.</p>

For Luithprande king of Lumbardie (being a in a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicious and deſirous to reigne alofte) chalenged that parte of Italie, which was before tyme in ſubiection to the Emperours of Conſtantinopole, to him ſelfe and his kingdome, in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pight of the popes noſe.

            <p>Whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it came to paſſe, that the Grelie Emperour beyng before dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out of Italie, by the Lumbardes force of armes, &amp; yet not cleane ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of his ryght and title of iuſte poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, hathe nowe loſt them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and beyng dryuen out of al hole Italie, hathe loſte al the Empire, that before he had in it.

And ſurely it is to ſee, the Popes ſubtile wylyneſſe to be ſuche, that they haue ꝓuided for their owne maters, at that tyme ſpecially, as they haue ſene the inperours and other kinges (that were againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) occupied with other warres, ſo as they ſhould be the leſſe hable to wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande their endeauours.

highe title of Moſt Chriſtian Kyng, <note place="margin">Moſt chriſtian king.</note> bothe to him &amp; his ſucceſſours: which the Frenchekinges are prowde of eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at this daye: for this one cauſe (you muſt vnderſtande) that they toke the places, which belonged to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in Italie, out of the Lumbardes handes, &amp; reſtored not them to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours agayne (as ryght was) but gaue them to the churche of Rome.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding al this gaire, the Popes ambicion &amp; couetouſneſſe was not ſatiſfied, as long as they ſawe the Lumbardes (whoſe powers were at that tyme exceading great in Italie) not al together ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; extinct. <note place="margin">King De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderius.

            <p>For Charles renneth through by &amp; by into Italie, with an hooſt of men: &amp; whan he mette Deſiderius wyth his armie of Lumbardes, he cruelly bette

And in dede thus was the reigne of the Lumbardes, which they hade poſſeſſed in Italie more than .CC. yeares all together deſpeched. And therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thrid horne was (through Antichriſtes ſubtilties and violence) ſmytten of alſo: in the yeare of our Lorde. DCClxxvi. Than Charles the Frenche king which was Pipines ſonne (after this gaire was done) came in to a perpetuall league wyth the Biſhoppes of Rome: and what his father Pipine hade geuen before to Stephane the ſeconde (of the landes that he hade violently taken from the Emperour) he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed the ſame alſo wyth more ample priuile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and with a ſolenne othe, to make ſure worke.</p>
            <p>Hitherto now, it hathe with cleare &amp; euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t expoſicion ben declared (wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued brethren in Chriſt) that the olde notable ſaienges of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy gooſt, which are in Daniel, be moſt truly fulfilled by the Biſhoppes of Rome: &amp;

For they (ꝙ he) dwelling &amp; being ſo very farre of, can be hable in no wiſe to aſſiſte ſely Italie, being many wayes diſtreſſed, eſpecially ſeing they were daily vexed with newe (and that moſt haynous) batailes. And therfore ſaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, peace, and freedome can not be better reſtored to Italie again, than if a newe choſen emperour in the weſt, take vpon him all the dignitie of the empire and the charge of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Theſe wordes in dede moued ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes heartes, which being ledde wyth the likelyhode of the wordes, perceaued not manifeſtly, what the popes drift was. Than perceauing the greateſt parte of the people to incline to his purpoſe, in the yeare of our Lorde Ieſu Chriſt. DCCCiij. he brought the mater to ful effecte.
<pb facs="tcp:20007:63"/>
For in Petres churche after the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ſeruice, by the ſentence and at the beſechinges of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people of Rome, the pope ordayned Charles (with a great lowde voice) emperour, &amp; gaue him the crowne Imperial: and ther vnto the people of the Romaynes ſhouted three tymes aloude: To Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les the mightie, crowned of God, the great and peacemaking Emperour, be life and victorie.</p>
            <p>And albeyt the greke emperours toke theſe maters right greuouſly, yet they were not hable to leſte theſe thinges fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doing: bothe in that they were turmoiled with innumerable warres, and alſo bicauſe the empreſſe Hirene (being polluted with the cruel murthering of her ſonne) ſtered vp newe hurly burlies, and exceding great ſtormes of buſyneſſe: for ſhe can in nowiſe ſeme to haue ben vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing of this dede, ſeing Charles (now made emperour) went about to mary her, ſhe her ſelfe not being diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

with wonderful ſleyght &amp; ſubtiltie to the highe dignitie of the empire: by whoſe helpe and mayntenaunce they became afterwarde of higher po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, than all their enemies.

            <p>Ther is no cauſe (welbeloued chriſtian brethren) why we ſhoulde maruaile, that the biſhop of Romes dignitie and power growed vp on ſuch an heyght, that he hade all the

            <p>Nowe though all theſe maters (which we haue hitherto made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſall of) are muche vnworthye, and alſo full of wickedneſſe and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, yet the biſhoppes of Rome not conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t herewith, thought they might be bolde, to doo more vnworthye &amp; more wicked entrepriſes tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al thoſe.

For the moſte raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng marchauntes are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to haue ſpoiled men of their goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, while they were alyue, but they go about to robbe and pille mennes heires, their wyues, and children al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, whan they are deade, and in an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other lyfe. For to this ende they haue ymagined trentalles, ſacrifices of Maſſing for the dead, anniuerſaries, and infinite ſuche like: and vnto them men muſt nedes either bequeath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall rentes and reuenues in their teſtament vpon their death bedde, or elles their heires muſt prouide and geue them. And what a thing is this elles, but the ſame that Chriſt obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the Scribes and Phariſees of the Iewes, where he ſayeth, that they deuoured and robbed poore folkes and wydowes houſes, vnder pretence of long prayer.

in this caſe, acquite them from ſynne and treſpace, ſeyng they bewray them ſelues by their owne dedes, yea and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the teſtimonye of their owne mouthe, to be theues and ſacrileges?</p>
            <p>For yf the pardon bulles which they offre to ſell for large money to men, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were yet lyuyng, were ſufficient for remiſſion of ſynnes (as they make boaſt of) what nede is it, to buye it dayly afreſhe wyth newe ſacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fices for them, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be dead? And foraſmuche as they ſaye, men haue nede of this ware, &amp; that dead mennes ſoules can not be delyuered wythout them, they doo verily ſhewe themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to be deceauours, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they deceat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fully &amp; fraudulently wyped their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from them, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were alyue, promiſyng perfite remiſſion of ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whych they them ſelues ſaye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde, is vnperfite, and hath nede of moo, and that newe wares.

And therfore we will ſaye, that this furſt title, that Paule decketh Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt withal, doth moſt rightly accord vnto him: that he is called the Man of ſynne, and the man addicte vnto ſi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, yea the ſeruaunt of ſynne, and a tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſlaue not only of ſynne, but alſo of moſt chief wickedneſſe &amp; blaſphemye.</p>

for his owne priuate commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) purpoſed to ſet twoo the mightieſt naciones of chriſtendome (Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and Germanye) together, to warre cruelly the one againſt the other: and glad to geue the loking on (him ſelf) of the deſtroyeng of cities, waſting of fiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, ſlaughter of men, and al the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief beſides, that warre bringeth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it: ſo that it turne to his owne aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>And here it is not to be omitted, that the biſhopes of Rome (being of the ſame ſpirite) did vnto Ladiſlaus king of Vngarie and Polone.

But whan the Turkes hade the ouerthrowe in that ſkyrmyſhe, they
<pb facs="tcp:20007:80"/>
were fayne perforce (and bicauſe of the condicions of peace) to medle no longer with inuading Vngarie, and beganne to make new roades in to Italie, &amp; to ſtere vp daungers againſt the pope: <hi>Eugenius</hi> the biſhop of Rome (to deliuer him ſelf and Italie from <note place="margin">Eugenius pope.</note> all daungier) ſent Cardinal Iuliane to <hi>Laudiſlaus,</hi> to condemne his league with the Turkes, as wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy: and to perſuade with all, that chriſtianes are in no wiſe bounden to kepe promiſe with infideles. And he gaue not ouer counſailing and prouoking, till he hade perſuaded the king, compelled him to breake the league, and ſo to become a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe breaker.

Hereof thoſe moſt holy fathers haue complayned in euery place. And where as before they turned the deafe eare to other mennes complaintes, nowe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playne them ſelues, &amp; with faire flattering wordes, moſt large ꝓmiſes, and muche feyned holyneſſe, they haue gone about to bring them that are inſtructed in the doctrine of the truthe, and haue renounced pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtrie, vnder the yowke of their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie agayne. But whan they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed nothyng for all their craftes, by and by they beſought ayde of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, Kinges, Princes, cities and people: they begonne to arme them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the profeſſours of the truthe,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:20007:82"/>
whome they crye out on, and ſaye, they folowe a newe and an hereticall religion.</p>
            <p>In this caſe therfore, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates (beyng ſtered vp by the popes incenſementes) begonne violently to rage with force of armes, againſt the faithfull ſeruauntes of Chriſt.

Yea the mater came to ſo merciles a crueltie, that they ſpared none, nother man nor woman, yonge nor olde. And yet thoſe noble rutterkines of the churche, dyd more cruell feates than theſe: for they enticed princes and people (whome ſo euer they coulde) for money, to ſtere vp warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge them ſelues, and to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhe the religion (that is contrary to them) wyth ſweorde and fyre. So that hangmen were ſent out of theſe parties, and raunged about here and there, to murthre the miniſters of the

worde, by what meane ſo euer they coulde. And they founde and toke vp burners, whom they hyred priuely, to thruſt vnder fyre, &amp; ſo to ſpoile, bothe the faythfull chriſtianes, and their cities and fieldes. And yet this read purpled churche (embrewed with the blood of ſayntes) not ſatiſfied with all theſe (as wicked cruell dedes as they were) ceaſſed not, before they percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued theſe haynous and bloody war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res brought vpon ſely ſorowful Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manye, ſtered vp all them that they truſted, to make batail againſt it. Bring vs out here the frutes of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, O you biſhoppes. Shewe here ſom ſpecial token of chriſten gentilneſſe, O you pope pleaſing ſlaues. Is it the office of charitie, to murdre men, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt hathe redemed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his blood, to ſpoile cities, to waſte fieldes, to marre corne, to defile matrones and maide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and finally to renne rageing (after al kyndes of iniuries and reproches) with ſweorde and fire, vpon all ages, man, woman, and childe?</p>
            <p>But they are heretikes (ſaye they) and no true chriſten people, that we perſecute. And the chaſte ſpouſe of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:20007:83"/>
Chriſt (the churche) is by theſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes moſt impudently defiled, and alſo the ſeameles coate of our ſaueour Ieſu, is (by their raſheneſſe, and falſe doctrines) miſerably torne, and rent in pieces: which we goo about to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende, and repaire agayne.</p>
            <p>Ha, &amp; will you nedes be bothe moſt bloody tirannes, and moſt ſhameles lyers to, you cruell blood thirſtye wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues? what adoo haue you, to ſpeake of Chriſtes coate? For by you it was cutte in pieces, and marred all ready a great while agoo: yea and by moſt wicked loctecaſting (as it was before tyme among the ſouldiours of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes) it cam in to moſt filthie mennes handelinges Therfore you are not ſory for tearing of Chriſtes coate: but it greueth you, that the vaile of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and the clooke of impietie is (through the preaching of the goſpel) cut in pieces, which you being coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red withal, haue continually hitherto practiced al kynde of wickedneſſe, and beaſly luſt, without correction.</p>
            <p>It greueth your hartes, that the ſackes are open and torne, which you haue hitherto hidden the true Ioſeph,
<pb facs="tcp:20007:84"/>
Ieſus Chriſtes cuppe, and all other your church robberies in. Now your ſleightie ſhiftes are open, your lies are open, your falſe deceates are open, nowe is your (more than the Sicilianes) tyrannye open, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred of all men. Your tyrannye was the toole, with the which you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged together by heapes, not only againſt mennes bodies, but againſt their ſoules alſo. It is the commyng of this gaire to the open light, that greueth you, hereof cometh your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, this is the cauſe of your ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe taking.</p>
            <p>For as touching the horrible cryme of hereſie (which is alwaies in your mouthe) which of our ſorte is it (I beſeche you) that you coulde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uince? haue you yet hitherto proued any of them, an heretike?</p>
            <p>They are heretikes, that make <note place="margin">who is an heretike.</note> new articles of the faithe, contrary to the truthe of the ſcripture, and doo ſtiffely mayntene them.</p>
            <p>This cryme is moſt farre from vs. For ther is none of the articles of the apoſtolike faithe and Crede, that we denye. And moreouer, we
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:20007:84"/>
deuiſe no newe ones, we chaunge none wrongfullye, we nother take from, nor put to any thyng, touchyng any of them. But ſuche maſking vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours you hade nede of, to bryng the doctrine of the truthe, and of the true faythe, in to hate and contempt, wyth the ſimple and rude common people, by meanes of this horrible and ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous reporte of vs, to be heretikes. But yf ye loued the churche of Chriſt, ſo muche as you boaſte in wordes to doo, yf you cared ſo muche, for the noble and moſt valeaunt nacion of the Germaynes: truely you teſtifye this your loue and care, wyth moſte vniuſte and moſt vnworthy behaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, in that you viſite it, wyth abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable force of armes, and moſte cruell haynous enemies, procured out of euery countrey. Did Chriſte our Lorde entrepriſe, to trayne the worlde to his lore, by the ſame lyke reaſones? Haue his Apoſtles lefte you any example of this practiſe? Par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>aduenture you maye pretende Paule for you in this caſe, which breathed the lyke threattes, and impugned the
<pb facs="tcp:20007:85"/>
faithfull chriſtianes with like force of armes, whan he was Chriſtes open enemye: and wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was ſaide to him, that he perſecuted the Lorde, &amp; ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">

But aſſone as he was conuerted, by the power of Chriſt, he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to teache and plant the chriſten faithe in euery place, and folowed farre other maner of wayes. But what nede wordes, againſt that ſcarlet blood thurſtye, and read ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Synagoge, coloured with ſayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes blood? For ther is ſuche obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and blyndeneſſe of harte in that Synagoges ſtomacke, that they will not voucheſafe ſo muche as heare the Lorde him ſelfe.</p>
            <p>It is our parte (dearely beloued brethren in Chriſt) to learne here, that theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ar cleane voide of al ſparkes of charitie, &amp; al together colde in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces.

therof, they wold neuer haue admitted, that (for their owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate profite) the people ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied now with ſweorde and fire, whom ſo ſore an hongre hathe ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vexed.</p>
            <p>But no common miſeries moue them, no caſualties moue them, no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentacion alſo of the ſorowfull wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched people moue them, ſo they may ſee their owne maters prouided for. As for the complaintes and pitifull cryenges of the poore, none pearceth their eares. The gronynges alſo of the afflicted, ſtrike nothing in to their eares, nother doo they geue any hede to the wailinges of the hongrie. But this is their common ſtudie, this is their care, this is their paynes taking and trauaile, to hunt away the ſely poore ſhepe (whom Chriſt hathe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demed with his blood) from the moſt holſome paſtures of Goddes worde, in to that olde ſtynking ſlaughter-houſe of theirs again: and to thintent whan they haue them vnder their ſubiection, they may not only fleece them at their pleaſures, but alſo pull of their ſkynne: and not that only, but

alſo bocherlye to ſlea them, woorie them, flea them, and deuoure them. Although ther periſhe men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, though fieldes be waſted, townes deſtroied, priuate and publike goodes violently taken away, though wyues crye out for the ſlaughter of their huſbandes, the parences of their ſonnes, the children of their parentes, the frendes and alliaunce, of their frendes and allyaunce: though the honeſtye of matrones be defiled, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the maidens (being ſubiecte to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querours filthie appetite) do make mone, though euery body (both man, woman, and childe) doo periſhe: &amp; to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, though al hole Germanye were ſet on a moſt terrible read bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng fire, yet they will thinke al this damage eaſyly recompenced, if they may lyue ſafely, and take their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, with their couent of erraunt hoores, flattering bely cheare myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones, and deteſtable daunceing leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.

            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:20007:86"/>
Let vs procede now ouer to the thrid point, which concerneth the leading of a righteous and an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent life: and therin we ſhal perceaue them to be Men of ſynne, no leſſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the other pointes before. For the innocencie of a chriſtian life requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this ſpecially aboue other, that we auoyde the common enemye of faythfull Chriſtianes, Sathan: that we abhorre, flee and deteſte to haue any thing a doo with him.

            <p>Therfore this furſt title that Paule geueth them, is expounded (or elles I am begyled) playnly ynough, and largely ynough agayne: and therof alſo it is moſt manifeſt, that the ſame title agreeth wyth no man in the worlde, better than w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the biſhop of Rome: forſomuche as out of his doctrine and example of lyuing, all
<pb facs="tcp:20007:95"/>
theſe abominacions (which we haue made rehearſal of) flowe, as out of a moſt plenteouſly ſpringing fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine: all which are contrarily repugnaunt againſt the veritie of faythe, againſt the lawe of charitie, &amp; againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie of lyfe.</p>
            <p>The ſeconde title that the Apoſtle Paule decketh Antichriſt wythall, is, <note place="margin">The ſonne of perdici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</note> that he nameth him The ſonne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion. But this title we muſt nedes take twoo maner of wayes: that is to ſaye, both actiuely and paſſiuely: ſo as furſt he is in dede loſt and da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned him ſelfe, than he alſo loſeth &amp; deſtroyeth al thoſe that be his complices and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and maketh them bonde ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to euerlaſting death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. But after what ſorte this title al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is aptely fitte for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhop of Rome, it maye be declared in fewe wordes. For furſt it is manifeſt by the auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the goſpelles doctrine, that all they are loſt and ſubiecte to eternall damnacion, that nother beleue in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, nor cleaue to his faythe &amp; doctrine. For Chriſt is the waye, the light, &amp; the truthe. And he is the onely <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Io.</hi> 14 <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.</note> dore by the which al we muſt entre in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:20007:95"/>
to his ſhepe folde: that is to wete, into the congregacion of ſaintes: and who ſo euer ſeketh any other dore, or coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to entre in any other waye, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth him ſelfe to be a thefe and a robber. And thervpon we heare Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Baptiſt ſaye: The father loueth the ſonne, and hath geuen him all thinges <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Io.</hi> 3.</note> into his hande. He that beleueth his ſonne, hath euerlaſting lyfe: and he that beleueth not the ſonne, ſhall not ſe lyfe, but the wrath of God abydeth on him.</p>
            <p>Nowe it is not poſſible, that ther ſhoulde be any ſaluacion, wher it is ſure, that the wrathe of God abydeth. But for aſmuche as the biſhop of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me beleueth not in the ſonne of God, nor hath not al his faythe &amp; truſte ſet in Chriſt alone, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only ſaueour of the worlde: it muſt nedes be, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath of God abideth vpon him, and that he is the loſt and bonde ſlaue of da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And the byſhop of Romes hole lyfe &amp; doctrine argueth, that he is moſt farre of from the faythe in Ieſus Chriſt, which beyng made ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our ſakes, redemed vs all w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his precious blood, vpon the altare of the croſſe, brake the power and lordſhip of deathe through
<pb facs="tcp:20007:96"/>
his deathe, and by his glorious aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in to heauen, ſet open the gates of euerlaſting bleſſedneſſe vnto vs wretched ſynners, and now before God the father of heauen, he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth our only patron and mediatour, and maketh ſure entraunce for vs, vnto the throne of grace. For if aman note the B. of Romes doctrine <hi>(Obiter)</hi> but euen lightly by the waye (as you wold ſaye he teacheth not Chriſt to be the only waye of ſaluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but beſides him he ſetteth out innumerable other wayes: as, ſo often repeted ſacrifices of maſſes, the hipocriticall exercice of falſe penaunce: auricular confeſſion (the moſt ſitte bayte of all treaſon, conſpiracie, ſedicion, lechery and all wickedneſſe) markettes of pardones, the colde ſcalding fyre of purgatorie pikepurce, prayeng to ſayntes depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and infinite other. For although he confeſſe Chriſt Ieſus the ſaueour of the hole worlde, in wordes and in mouthe, and ſo glorieth in his name, yet he denyeth him, ſo often as he attributeth to an other (whether it be ſaynt, or worke and merite) the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that perteyne to none but Chriſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20007:96"/>
alone. For by what reaſon ſhall we ſaye, that he beleueth, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt beyng ſacrificed once for all, vpon the altare of the croſſe, offred a perpetuall ſufficient ſacrifice vnto God the father for our ſynnes, whan he goeth about to offre hym dayly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhe, at the celebracion of the Maſſe? How ſhall he beleue, that he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and fully redemed from the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſſe of his ſinnes by Chriſtes me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, which goeth aboute to redeme him ſelfe, wyth his owne merites of his owne workes? How ſhall he alſo knowe Chriſt Ieſus, to be his onlye Mediatour, Patrone, &amp; interceſſour, whych hathe infinite other, whether they be he ſayntes or ſhe ſayntes, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtede of mediatours &amp; interceſſours? And yet it is certain, that men are brought to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> point, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> B. of Romes doctrine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they folow both theſe &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny other thinges, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trari to Chriſt, and his doctrine. Therfore this is euidently manifeſt alſo, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Biſ. of Rome is moſt farre of (mater in dede) from the faythe in Chriſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he vſe to profeſſe him with his mouthe, &amp; bragge much of his name.
<pb facs="tcp:20007:97"/>
As for this mater, the example of his life is not behinde alſo, in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">what fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the is.</note> playne recorde of. For faithe is a certain lyuing and a continuall working power &amp; energie, that ſitteth not idle in mennes conſciences: and is not (as many falſe chriſtianes thinke) a certain naked and vayne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is deſritute of certain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones: but it is a good tree, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with perpetuall iuyce, which beareth no euil nor rotten frute, but is alwaies abundauntly full of good and acceptable frutes to God, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie and charitie. But it is now proued allready by ſufficient demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracion, that the biſhoppes of Rome haue no charitie, they haue alſo no in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nocencie of life and maners, but they are moſt farre of, bothe from the true faithe, and true religion: Wherupon this plainly foloweth alſo, that they beare in no condicion that good tree of a ſyncere faithe in their heart, but rather that euil and vnprofitable one, at whoſe roote the are is allready ſet, that it maye be cut of, and ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and caſt in to the vnquencheable fire of hell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:20007:97"/>
Therfore who will henſfurthe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlage the biſhop of Rome, to be the head of the ſayntes, and faithfull people? Who will cal him holy father, yea rather holyneſſe it ſelfe? Finally who can ſaye, that he is the leader vnto ſaluacion, and the portour of heauen gate, whan by the example of his owne life, and preceptes and decrees of his wicked doctrine, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth him ſelf (according to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Paules ſentence) to be bothe Antichriſt, and the ſonne of perdicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</p>
            <p>Hereof alſo that other mater is gathered, that like as he him ſelf is loſt, euen ſo dothe he make all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his religion and ſecte, bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de ſlaues to perdicion and euerlaſting deathe. For how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it poſſibly be, that they ſhal be hable to com to the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hal of bleſſedneſſe, which folowe a guyde, that gothe (with ſtraight and ſtedfaſt ſteppes) the hye waye to hell?</p>
            <p>How ſhall we alſo ſaye, it maye be, that they ſhould be vnited to Ieſu Chriſt, the only redemour of vs all, which haue choſen ſuche a one to be their guyde, that is againſt Chriſt in
<pb facs="tcp:20007:98"/>
al thinges, and robbeth him of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſhameleſly attributeth the ſame to other? In this caſe therfore, it is neceſſary to vſe moſt diligent circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection. In this behalfe it ſtandeth vs in hande, ſtrongly to ſharpen oure wittes. Herein it behoueth vs to open the eyes of our minde, moſt dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued brethren in Chriſt. For it is no flyrting mater (as many men thinke) to ſticke ſtil in the B. of R. wayes, &amp; ſo to holde harde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> popiſhe religion to the &amp; naile. The ſaluacion of ſoules is in haſarde, dearly beloued. For either we muſt be vnited to the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father, by the interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and benefite of one only Chriſt, &amp; ſo lyue for euer: or elles be drawen awaye from him, &amp; periſhe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Antichriſt for euer. And ther is ſo much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more greuous preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gier henging ouer our ſoules, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde wold haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowlage of his worde, to be opened vnto vs. For inaſmuche as the lyght of Goddes worde hathe diſcuſſed and wyped away, thoſe gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and horrible darkeneſſes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianitie, ſo as the health geuing face of Chriſt, and alſo the compaſſe of this cruell beaſtes mouthe, and the ſeate of abominacions, is ſhewed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:20007:98"/>
before our eyes: we maye neuer (from henſfurthe) eyther pretende ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce, to clooke our vnbelefe, or excuſe it wyth the godlyneſſe and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie of our zele or good intent. For God hathe preſcribed the rule of his worde vnto vs, for this ende: that we ſhoulde honour hym according to his owne commaundement, and that we ſhoulde not folowe that foliſhe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall zele of ours, which is wythout knowlage of all truthe. The ſtubbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſuche men is muche lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly therfore to be bewailed (brethren) which wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they heare Goddes worde wyth their eares, and are conuicte w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the truthe therof in their conſciences, ſo as they may ſee their errours, and fele the intolerable burthen of ſuche exceding tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie: yet had rather ſticke ſtiffely to their knowen ſuperſticion, than to folowe Chriſt the only waye of ſaluacion. But wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men moſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably become to that poi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may warne &amp; exhorte them, &amp; all but loſt labour, we muſt permitte them to their owne appetite. For they ſhal ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely fele, that their ſtubberneſſe ſhal-be ones a great deale to their coſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20007:99"/>
Now are we come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thrid title, <note place="margin">An aduer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſary.</note> wherwyth Paule painteth out the per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſone of Antichriſt: which conteyneth the ſelf ſame propretie, and the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſo mightie abominableneſſe, &amp; the certain ſure marke, for the which he is called Antichriſt. For he calleth him an aduerſary: that is, he myndeth to ſet him out to be-ſuche a one, that ſhoulde be againſt, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, and in al thinges (as it were) vtterly ſette for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anempſt Chriſt, of whoſe name &amp; title he only braggeth, <note place="margin">The right vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding of this worde Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is plaine, that he glorieth in the name of Chriſt. Wherupon euen the right vnderſtanding of this worde, teacheth this, that he ſhal be an aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Chriſt our Lorde, and gayne-ſaye all thoſe thinges, that are ſet out by Chriſt, either in doctrine, or in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of life, wyth the ſtatutes of his doctrine, and wyth the example of his life.</p>
            <p>Than if we can geue the biſhop of Rome this title alſo, wyth ſufficient demonſtracion, as his owne propre good (as in dede we haue ouercome all, that we toke in hande to proue yet hitherto) it ſhall alſo manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:20007:99"/>
that the B. of Rome, is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that very right and great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, altough the autoritie of all the worlde crye out againſt it: which (if it wolde contrary the worde of God) were non autoritie at all. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as all thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are in Chriſt our ſaueour, maye be comprehended in his life &amp; doctrine, as in two moſt general chaptres: it behoueth, that we conſidre them bothe, that it maye ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by euidently appeare, that the B. of Rome dothe contrarie to Chriſt, both in life and in doctrine, and therfore is his aduerſarie, and very Antichriſt. And furſt of all, we will ſpeake of bothe their lyues, that is to ſaye, of Chriſt and Antichriſt.</p>

For if the B. of Rome be Chriſtes vicare, it muſt nedes be, that Chriſt is not preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with his churche. <note place="margin">The falſe boaſt of the B. of Rome. to be chriſtes Vicare.</note> For he that any where occupieth an office, and kepeth reſidence preſently vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, as apperteyneth: hathe no nede of any vicare. But Chriſt Ieſus, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as he is the head of his owne churche, can in no wiſe be diſſeuered from his body, which is the churche, but is inſeperably preſent with his churche ſpiritually, contynually to the worldes ende. Therfore the B. of Rome is not moued by any warrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the truthe (but of a wicked luſt to blaſpheme) to boaſt him ſelf to be Chriſtes vicare.</p>
            <p>Hitherto therfore I ſuppoſe it be ſufficiently ynough declared, that the B. of Rome deſerueth this thrid title, wherwith Paule painteth him out, after ſuch ſorte, that he may (by al meanes) be called An aduerſarie, that is to ſaye, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary and againſt Chriſt in all thinges, inaſmucheas all his

conuerſacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; his doctrine are cleane contraryly repugnaunt againſt the doctrine and conuerſacion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now remayneth the fourthe title, wherwith Paule decketh Antichriſt, <note place="margin">Exalted aboue God.</note> whom he dothe not comprehende in one only worde, but deſcribeth it in moo. For he ſaithe, he ſhal be ſtately &amp; prowde, and exalte him ſelf (with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table arrogauncie) aboue all, that is either called, or worſhipped, by the name of God. Yea his folie ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede ſo farre (ſaith he) that he ſhal place his ſeate, in the Temple of God as God, and ſhewe him ſelf, as though he were a God.</p>
            <p>To theſe wordes of Paule, the deſirous man Daniel conſenteth, who ſpeaking of Antichriſtes miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſaith, that the litel horne (by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Antichriſt is figured) hade a mouthe, wherwith he ſpake certain preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous thinges: that is to ſaye, in tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of diuine maters: of chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geing of lawes and tymes, &amp; of other maters infinite which (it is plaine) are in the power of none but God alone. And again in the. 11. chap. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiel (ſpeaking of the ſame) ſaithe thus:
<pb facs="tcp:20007:108"/>
And the king ſhall do what he luſteth, and exalte and enlarge him ſelf, aboue all Goddes, and ſhal ſpeake maruelous thinges againſt the moſt high God. And a litel after. He ſhall not alſo care for the Goddes of his forefathers, no, he ſhall care for no God at all: for he ſhall preferre him felf aboue all.</p>
            <p>Now if we compare all theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which are ſpoken by the apoſtle Paule, and Daniel the prophet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of this fourthe title (which is attributed vnto Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt) ſhal appeare manifeſt vnto vs. For this is the will of the ſpirite to ſaye: that Antichriſt ſhal be a man of moſt high arrogauncie, and ſwelling foliſhe inſolencie, which (with prowde bolde enterpriſe) ſhall take vpon him ſelf thoſe offices, which are mete to be attributed to none, but to God alone: and are to be applyed to none but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God. This is not ment by Paules wordes, and the literall ſenſe of the ſame: Noman at all can make him ſelf a God: nor alſo, ther is none other God, but that one only eternall God, al though any man (hauyng autoritie to perſuade, ioyned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> arrogauncie) come to ſo highe a pride and ſtately<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20007:108"/>
as to be honored &amp; worſhipped, of a ſorte of leude perſons &amp; fooles, as we reade, that <hi>Caligula</hi> and <hi>Domicianus</hi> were. We muſt therfore marke well the B. of Romes maters, whether we can be hable to fynde any ſuche, as take vpon them ſelues this moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogaunt title alſo: to the intent the hole perfite deſcripcion of Antichriſtes perſone may be euidently manifeſt vnto vs. And that ther are ſuche in <note place="margin">The B. of R. taketh vpon him the honour of God head. what God is.</note> dede, it ſhall appeare of their owne ſayenges and writinges.</p>
            <p>And furſt of al, God is naturally he, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſſence and life of al thinges, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo al thinges haue receaued &amp; haue life, &amp; to be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are.

For like as out of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes head (as it were out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pype of a fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne) the nouriſhemet of life floweth downe in to the hole bodie and all the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence is diſtrubuted, as it is nedefull to euery membre:

This is the plaine vndoubted office of the head: &amp; Chriſt (the head of his churche) ꝑfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the ſame abundauntly. Than if we marke well y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> B. of Rome (whom we cal Antichriſt) it ſhal appea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re more cleare than the daye light, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this arrogau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie is in him, by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which be openly boaſteth him ſelf, to be the head of all the hole churche.

In this mater we paſſe not greatly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papiſtes obiectiones, that thinke they can auoide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> note of ſo great an

feble &amp; ſickly, that hathe no whitte of the ſpirite of life in it at all. And if you haue not the ſpirite of life, truly you ſhal not be the churche of Chriſt. For the churche of Chriſt hathe in poſſeſſion, bothe the ſpirite of Chriſt &amp; life in him. But the B. of Ro. will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer acknowlage him ſelf, to be a dead head: &amp; therfore as long as he (like a right foliſhe inſolent man) is prowde of that title, he ſitteth in the temple of God, &amp; boaſteth him ſelf to be God. Now ther foloweth an other mater, wherin the B. of Rome boaſteth him ſelf (no leſſe than in the other before) to be God: and exalteth him ſelf aboue the only &amp; true God. For he reioyceth to be called holy father, &amp; yet not conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But &amp; if he be holyneſſe (as they call him, &amp; as he wilbe called) it behoueth

of neceſſite, that he maye ſanctifie or make other holy, yea as many as are and be called holy, ſhal be ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified or made holy of him. But we be taught a farre contrary iudgement (fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) out of the holy ſcriptures, O brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For the ſcriptures teache, that the one only God is proprely (by him ſelf and of him ſelf) holye, and very holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelf: and alſo that as many as are called holy for faithes ſake, are not ſanctified, that is, are not pourged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the filthyneſſe of ſynnes, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated vnto God, of them ſelues, nor of their owne power, but of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus, by the holy gooſt. And in this mater, ther maye many thinges be brought out of the bokes of the holy ſcripture, which moſt euidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte the ſame. For in dede Chriſt (as Iohan maketh mencion) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monyng <note place="margin">

And that ther is nothing elles vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den therby, but the grace of God, and the operacion of the holy gooſt, it is more

            <p>What can be ſpoken more briefly, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe wordes are? What thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo can be ſpoken more openly &amp; plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, concernyng our ſanctificacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? For he taketh quyte awaye all maner rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſanctificacion, that can be yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by any other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes elles: and teacheth that we are waſhed, iuſtified, and ſanctified of non other, but of our Lorde &amp; ſaueour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt alone, and that by the holy ſpirite of our God, which alſo is very God him ſelfe. And hereof it cometh, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the holy gooſt is often tymes (in the ſcriptures) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to water, bicauſe in dede, like as water waſheth awaye the filthineſſe of the body, euen ſo dothe the holy gooſt ſcowre and clenſe the ſoule. For the ſame cauſe ſake, the holy gooſt is compared alſo vnto fyre, becauſe he enlumineth not only our

            <p>And as this is the power of none but of the holy gooſt alone, ſo is ther none other ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctificatour me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cioned, vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to vs in any place of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole ſcripture, but he alone, which is alſo very God him ſelfe, and of one ſelfe ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; power, with God the father and the ſonne.</p>

            <p>To be brief, if we will ſet all this aparte, and loke vpon their owne Canones and decrees, than we ſhal at leynght heare thoſe wonderfull and preſumptuous thinges, which Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt (according to Danieles ꝓphecie) is accuſtomed to bring out againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde. For they are not content to haue claymed to the B. of Rome, the dominion of all the churche, and of the hole compaſſe of chriſtendome, but they alſo write, that he hathe ſuche power and autoritie, either to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde or inhibite, what he will at his pleaſure, that all men are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den neceſſarily to obeye him, yea euen in thoſe maters, which are ſcarcely tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that he commaundeth. Beſides this, they procede further on, &amp; ſaye, that non other man hathe any auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie at all, to iudge of him: and ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſuch autoritie vnto him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſaye, he ought to be iudged of no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in what dede ſo euer he dothe. But now let vs heare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beaſt him ſelf ſpeake. Pope Agatho in his 19. diſt. <note place="margin">Pope aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho.</note> writeth to all biſhoppes on this ſorte: All the decrees of the ſee apoſtolike, are
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:20007:115"/>
ſo to be accepted, as though they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by the diuine worde of Petre him ſelf.</p>
            <p>Again Boniface theight, in his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauagauntes. Com. Li.</hi> 1. <hi>Tit. De Maioritate &amp;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Boniface the.</hi> 8.</note> 
               <hi>obedientia</hi> comprehendeth the hole my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of this beaſt in ſuche wiſe, that if ther were non but that one only place, it were hable to proue him, to be the ſame, that we ſaye he is. For furſt after he hathe proued, that ther is but one churche, he claymeth the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie and dominion of it to him ſelf, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a very goodly kynde of argument.</p>
            <p>This (ꝙ he) is the ſeameles coate which was not cut in pieces, but came by caſting of lottes.</p>
            <p>And theſe wordes Boniface ſpeaketh truly, as the mater is in dede. For if Chriſtes coate (the churche) came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhoppes of Rome by caſti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of lottes, than truly they are not ſucceſſours of the apoſtle Petre, but of the moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hangmen, that caſt lottes for our Lordes coat vnder the croſſe, whan he him ſelf loked vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> barlot bewrayeth him ſelf, in his owne tale telli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. But let vs tel on: Therfore ther is but one bodye of one only churche,
<pb facs="tcp:20007:116"/>
and one head (not two heades, lyke a monſtre) that is to wete, Chriſt and his vicare Petre, and Petres ſucceſſour.</p>
            <p>What an open contradiction is in theſe wordes? He ſaythe, ther is but one head of the churche, leaſt he ſhould make the churche a monſtre. And yet in thus ſayeng, he ſetteth two heades vpon it, farre vnlyke the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that is to ſaye, Chriſt very true God and man, and Petre a mortall man and a ſynner, whych acknowla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth him ſelfe, to be delyuered, not by his owne righteouſneſſe, but by the merite of Chriſt. And yet for al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, they thruſt them ſelf ſhameleſly in withal.</p>
            <p>Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what ſhifte ſhal the moſt holy fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers make in this caſe? Wil they ſay, that Chriſt &amp; Petre are both but one, &amp; the ſelf ſame one? That they can not be hable to doo in any wyſe. But they ſay not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Petre is the very head ſelf, but the vicare of Chriſt, the very true head. And tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they make them ſelues ſucceſſours to Petre. Nowe good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, at what tyme doth Chriſt the head de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte from his body, to geue place of vicarſhip vnto Petre? Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo dothe the office &amp; glorie of the head returne vnto you, if Chriſt and Petre be bothe

abſent. Verily you ſeme to make the church like vnto thoſe ymages, which haue twoo heades, the one for worke daies, and the other (being a more ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>launt head) they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly weare at no tyme, but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne holydaies.</p>
            <p>But leaſt the father of this mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtre Boniface, might lightly haue ben laught to ſcorne, he woulde grounde him ſelf vpon the autoritie of ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. For he ſaithe, that theſe wordes ought thus to be beleued, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Lorde ſpeaketh to Petre: Fede my ſhepe, Myne (ꝙ he) and that generally &amp; not ſingularly theſe or thoſe ſhepe: by the which it is vnderſtanden, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all vnto him vniuerſally. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whether they be grekes or others, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaye, they were not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto Pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tre &amp; his ſucceſſours, they muſt confeſſe of neceſſite, that they are none of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ſhepe: Wher as the Lorde ſaithe in Iohan, that ther is but one ſhepefolde, and one ſhepehearde.</p>
            <p>Who is he, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wolde not be aſtonied at this gaire, brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? who is he, that wold not abhorre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force of this argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment? Chriſt ſaide to Petre, Fede my ſhepe. Ergo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> B. of of Rome is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head
<pb facs="tcp:20007:117"/>
of the church. A ioyly concluſion. But how ſhal it be ꝓued, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to fede Chriſtes ſhepe, &amp; to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head of the church, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth al one thing?

Or what ſhal we ſaye, to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whiche was enioyned to the other diſciples, whan the Lorde ſayd: Go into the hole vniuerſal worlde, and preache the goſpel to al creatures? And yet that ſhal you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute to, in caſe you proue the goſpell, to be nother y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> foode of the ſoule, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pleaſaunt paſtures, for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces to fede on. But admit we grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you this: what a doo hath Chriſt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Belial, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Symon Magus, or w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the B. of R? But they muſt nedes be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meles ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dlers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane thinges, are voide of al ſhame.</p>
            <p>Wel, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame Canone, Boniface gothe on, &amp; claymeth alſo the ſecular power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> emperour to him ſelf, leaſt in diſputing of diuine power, he loſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other. And at leynght he cometh to the ful purpoſed ende of his diſputacion, &amp; concludeth after this ſorte. Therfore who ſo euer reſiſteth this power thus

For as Moſes recor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth, God made heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earthe not in the beginninges, but in the beginning. And finally we declare, ſaye, define and pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to be of playne neceſſitie of ſaluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al humaine creatures be ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iect to the B. of R. Doeſt y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> now make vs a newe article of faithe &amp; ſaluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Boniface?

            <p>Hereunto is applied the ſayeng that is written. <hi>Cap. Quanto de. Tranſlat. Epiſc. tit.</hi> 7. the pope is reported to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> arbitre of heauenly thinges, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he chaungeth the nature of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in applieng the ſubſtaunces of one thing to an other.

            <p>Lo, theſe be thoſe preſumptuous &amp; wonderfull wordes of Antichriſt, dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely beloued brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Chriſt: by the whiche he gothe about to ſeme, not only to be like God, but alſo to be grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter and of more excellencie than God. For he ſaithe not only, that he can make ſomthing of nothing (which is the office of non, but of the only power and vertue of God) but alſo (according to Daniels prophecie) he teacheth that all rightes and lawes are vnder his arbitrament: ſo muche that euen in them he maye diſpenſe, as it pleaſeth him ſelf, &amp; make wrong to be right, yea and that vnright ſhal be taken for right, if he ſo geue ſentence.

Wherto doo we any more laughe the Iewes dreames to ſcorne? or deteſte the blaſphemyes of Mahomete, ſeing greater maters &amp; of more crueltie are ſpoken, &amp; (not without feare) heard of among chriſtian menne, and that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

            <p>Is it than the propretie of an head, to rage againſt his owne membres, and to caſt them vpon ſweorde and fire, to be deſtroied?

            <p>Forſothe a goodly addicion, O you blocke headed Canoniſtes.

            <p>But who is that (brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) that hath brought in theſe ſortesof men?

For although a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were ſoiled in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſynke of al the ſynnes, that are in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde, and ledde a life full of al myſchief and wickedneſſe, all the hole yeare long, yet the only tyme of lent (though a man contynue ſtill in ſynnes) were hable to make him holy &amp; righteous.

            <p>Beſydes this, it is more cleare than the ſunne light, that ther can non ſo outrageous, none ſo cruel, non ſo hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, non ſo abominable a ſynne be committed, but it may be clooked by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> popes Bulles, and pardoned &amp; quyte remitted by the autoritie of his ſea.</p>

tie and ſtrong God: that is, he hathe deuiſed for him ſelf ſuche a God: by whoſe ſeruice and religion, he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced with great abundaunce of richeſſe, honour, and glorie. And to vnderſtande this mater the more fully, thus we muſt take it, good bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; If we marke the B. of Rome, he will profeſſe with his mouthe the ſelf ſame God, whom we acknowla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge in the articles of the apoſtles Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det howbeit playeng the hipocrite in this poynt, as he dothe in all other maters, he beleueth him not to be ſuche a God, as he vſeth to profeſſe him to be. For if a man marke his tradicions, and ſtrayne him a litell harder, he ſhall ſee, that he beleueth not, that God the father hath a ſonne, which became man for our ſakes, and (being offred vp once for all on the altare of the croſſe for vs) obteyned forgeueneſſe of ſynnes, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſaluacion for mankynde. But he ymagineth a farre other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of God, that is daily coniured by maſſemonging prieſtes enchaunte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, to come downe in to breade, or in to the forme of breade, and the

            <p>For theſe are plaine contraries: to be incarnate, and to com downe in to a cake of bread: to be offred vp once for all, on the aultare of the croſſe, &amp; many tymes vpon the popiſhe prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes aultares: to be offred only once by hym ſelf, and euery daye a thouſaunt tymes by other prieſtes: to be aſcended in to heauen, and to lye locked in a golden Pixe: to ſytte on the fathers right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, vnto the daye of iudgement, and to com downe daily at the prieſtes coniuring in his bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſence in to a piece of breade.</p>

And yet this is euen that ſtrong and mightie God, by whoſe ſeruice and helpe, Antichriſt is promoted vnto moſt highe power and dignitie. For after that the rude ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were perſuaded, that Ieſus Chriſt (very God and very man) was called out of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the prieſtes wordes, and that they handled him with their conſecrated handes, and offred him for mennes ſynnes, anon they were in ſuche autoritie with all men, that euery man hade them in moſt highe honour, yea ther was none almoſt ſo euil aduiſed, that thought not him worthye to be punyſhed, who ſo euer attempted any thing againſt them.</p>
            <p>And this augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted their dignitie and power alſo, that whan they hade made this their God with their owne wordes, they deliuered him to other alſo to be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, howbeit not vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body at aue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture, but vnto ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as were contented to ſhryue them before hande vnto them, of all that they hade ſynned, either by worde or dede. For by this ſecrete Legier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne of Confeſſion that they haue deuyſed, they could knowe the botom
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:20007:134"/>
of all mennes heartes, they could le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arne out all mennes purpoſes, they could boult out, what al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thought: yea they could (by thoſe goſtly fathers of their owne making) knowe the moſt ſecrete intentes and pryuie cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſailes of kinges and princes. For this was the othe of them all, that they were bounde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the ſea of Rome by, that they ſhould (to the vttermoſt of their poſſible power) withſtande al mennes purpoſes and entrepriſes, and by all poſſible meanes, to lette thoſe thinges, which they knewe to be noyſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the B. of Rome and his ſea. By reaſon wherof, aſſone as the B. of Rome beganne to haue any king or prince in ſuſpicion, that he bare but ſmall good will to his popiſhe digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or power: anon theſe goſtly fathers wold grope him, &amp; with crafty trickes ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle him ſo, that ther were no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but he muſt nedes ſhryue hym, &amp; poure into their boſoms, not only all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had done, but alſo al his intentes &amp; purpoſes. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whan they ſawe any dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger like to riſe, or already in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de againſt the ſea of Rome, they were bounden by their othe, to open all the

hole mater to their ordinary. And the ordinarie muſt ſhewe it to his ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and bidde him declare it to his biſhop, or to the archebiſhop, by whoſe meanes it came at leynght to the pope him ſelfe. And whan he once knewe the mater, he could ſone make ſhifte, to turne vp ſyde downe al the attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, that any prince hade intended againſt him.</p>
            <p>And by this meanes (brethren) we ſee it come to paſſe by experience, that ther is no king nor prince, no nor yet emperour, that coulde be founde ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo prudent, or ſo valeaunt a man, in compaſſing of his maters, that yf he were offended at the tyrannye of the biſhoppes of Rome, was hable yet either to ſuppreſſe it, or to eſcape it: no mary, a great ſorte of them haue ben conqueſted and oppreſſed, by the drif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and craftie conueyaunces of the biſhoppes of Rome.

            <p>This we reade was done the yeare from Chriſtes birth, M. CCC.

For he worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth not, nor ſerueth him, as the true lyuyng God ought to be ſerued and worſhipped, in ſpirite and truthe: but as the prophete Daniel ſpake before-ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> golde, ſiluer, precious ſtones, and other gaye gaire, as they can not denye, ſeyng all the hole god ſeruice, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they occupie them ſelues withal, is as I ſaye.

not lyue alone, but in the lawes of wedlocke or matrimonie, which we call the laufull coupling together of one man and of one woman, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Goddes inſtitucion.

ſeing it was he, that ſhould by leaſure worke the myſterie of iniquitie.

            <p>But to tell what frutes haue proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of this law; it nedeth not much re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hearſal.

            <p>Such a maner of parte (we reade) was plaide about the yeare of our Lorde MCCC. whan the B. of Rome appointed the realme of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to Al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bertus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romanes, &amp; wolde haue depryued king Philip of his aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cient poſſeſſion, bicauſe he wolde haue ſtopped the open entries of his real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, to holde out the rauenyng Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.

by &amp; by the B. of Rome ſtripped him out of his biſhoplie honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and a newe biſhop (at the ſame B. of Romes commaundement) was put in his rowme. That mater was the occaſion of wonderful ſore diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiones, and warres, that many prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Germanie (yea and that the greateſt princes) were combred with al. But the ende of that tragedie was a moſt bloody piece of worke.

receaued her eie ſight, and hauing throwne awaye the yowke of the popes tyrannie, will nother acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage the B. of Rome ſupreme head of the churche, nor vouchethſafe to worſhip and ſerue that God of his, Mayzim: the B. of Rome thought it not ynough to make warres vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wretche people, that hade ben long punniſhed with hongre, and dearthe of euery thing: but alſo (to make mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciles cruell ſouldiours the more gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy vpon vs) he wold haue al Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and all the ſubſtaunce therof, to be his mennes praye.

than we haue proued thoſe maters, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue treated vpon al this while hitherto.

            <p>After that, Pipines ſonne Carolus magnus, being deceaued with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like errour, confirmed that his father had geuen: and gaue more alſo of his owne.

the biſhoppes of Rome with in theſe LLC. yeares paſt, that is to ſaye, the yeares of our Lorde. M. LLXX. and. M. CCxxiij. yet they haue goten ſo muche ſubſtaunce and richeſſe with in ſo ſhorte a tyme, as were ynough to fynde many thouſauntes a lyuing. Beſides this we ſee, that they haue builded ſo many monaſteries (muche fairer than kinges and princes pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) ſo as a man can not fynde either any king or emperour, that were ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to beare the coſtly charges therof. And yet not content with theſe, they haue gote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together ſo many ymages of great wedges of golde and ſiluer, ſo many chalices, ſo many patines, ſo many candleſtyckes, ſo many diſhes, and infinite other ſuche kynde of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles of golde and ſiluer, yea and ſo many copes and veſtme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, broudred with golde, &amp; ſet with precious ſtones, that if they were laide all vpon an heape, they were hable to excede the wealthe of <hi>Craeſus</hi> and <hi>Myda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This we maye ſaye furthermore, as the truthe of the mater it ſelfe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth: that theſe holy theues (that are the chiefeſt braggers of pouertie)
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:20007:143"/>
are come to ſo highe wealthe, that a poore greaſy graye frier may walke all the worlde ouer almoſt, and coſt him neuer a peny, bicauſe he may fynde euery daye a houſe of graye friers, and ther lyue as it were of his owne, among his brethren. And in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dede theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are the moſt beggerly, of al the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres that Antichriſt hath. I ſpeake not now of mytred biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, and ſwaſhing abbottes, which wilbe called and regarded as princes, and kepe aſtate as if they were Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. I ſpeake not of Cardinalles and popes, which goo farre beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly princes, in wealthe &amp; in ſtreynght of reignyng. Tuſhe, the deuil is ſo muche theſe mennes good Lorde, and they haue ſo muche dominion ouer the treaſures of the earthe, that thoſe thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges be eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne good, which other men haue the poſſeſſion of, and are not yet deliuered vnto their han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. For aſſone as their deſire is, to enlarge their ſubſtaunce, they haue an hundred knackes in their budget, to pike mennes ſecrete treaſures, out of their priuie coafers. For the helpe of this mater ſerue their oft chaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and encreaceing of their pardon bulles, their newe ſtacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, newe fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de reliques, and preaching of the croſſe, againſt the inuaſions of the Turkes, and other ſuche like trickes, wherw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their cuſtome is (lyke vnſaciable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moranes) to rauine &amp; deuoure vp all to them ſelues.

            <p>Now remayneth the ſeuenth and <note place="margin">7. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt the Sayntes.</hi>
               </note> laſt worke of Antichriſt, which is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in fewe wordes, by Daniel in his 7. Cha. where he writeth, that the litel horne (that is to ſaye, Antichriſt) made batail againſt the ſaintes, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uailed againſt them. And in dede this is his owne right natural worke, for w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out it he could in no wiſe be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. For ſeing Antichriſt is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſary of Ieſus Chriſt, our Lorde &amp; only ſaueour, bothe in name and mater, he muſt nedes make warre againſt all them, that faithfully beleue in Chriſt, &amp; are ſanctified by his merite &amp; death. For they are not only called ſaintes in <note place="margin">who be cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led Saintes in the ſcriptures.</note> the ſcriptures, which ar departed this lyfe, and reigne in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as the rude ſorte of popiſhe people are wont to

thinke) but al ſuche alſo as are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, clenſed, &amp; waſhed by the blood of the ſonne of God, yea &amp; all maner of faythfull people, that knowe that they are ſcoured cleane, from the filthe of their ſinnes, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only merite of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes death &amp; paſſion, and ſtedfaſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, that they are made righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God the father, &amp; ſhall lyue after this lyfe for euer, and enioye the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites of ſuche a ioyous felicitie, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall ende. And theſe ſayntes hathe the B. of Rome alwayes made bataile againſt, with the violent force of his tirannie, as one that could neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde the faith &amp; religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they were of. For yf men holde of none, but only Chriſt, yf they put their hole truſt in the merite of his death, &amp; yf they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe him to be the ſole &amp; only ſaueour and redemer of al the hole world: tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maye the B. of Rome put vp his py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may he take his leaue of his great gainyng money marte, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his pardone marchaundiſe ſtynketh, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Bulles are not ſette a ſtrawe by, than gothe his great gaynes of golde and ſiluer awaye, that hade wonte to come in for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoules, that lye pewling

            <p>But how wold ye haue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to abyde this, that are all together geuen to delices, voluptuouſſneſſe, and pride? Therfore ther is claſhing of olde har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and batail is a brewing againſt the Lordes ſayntes, wherunto the B. of Rome bothe geueth the on ſette, and taketh vp the mater. As for this gaire, we may ſee it to be true, more clearely tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the daye light, if we note, what hathe happened w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in the ſpace of this one age. In Boheme, God by <note place="margin">Ioh.

But aſſone as he (like a godly &amp; a bleſſed man) begonne to attempte this mater, theſe purpled fathers, and ambicious ruffli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g luſty guttes, being
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:20007:145"/>
afraide, leaſt their power &amp; dignitie wolde decaye, neuer ceaſſed layeng baites to catche him, till they hade (throughe falſe flatring promiſes) brought him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in their clowches, at the counſail of Conſtaunce, &amp; ther (con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trarie to their open fidelitie, yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the emperours faithfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe alſo) they burned him: and for non other cauſe, but for the truthes ſake. And yet not being content w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haynous crueltie, vniuſt doing, and falſehead, they alſo moued muche cru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ell warres, againſt the Bohemies, &amp; ſtered vp the force and power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole empire, ſondry tymes againſt them.</p>
            <p>But what nede we to rehearſe olde exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples? Let vs marke their doinges in our dayes, and we ſhal ſone knowe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> batailes, that Antichriſt maketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lordes ſayntes. For euery man knoweth, that his tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie hathe ben ſo cruell (now for theſe 20. yeares and more) that no man lyuing might (ſo hardye) fynde fault at their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable popiſhe ſuperſticion: no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might alſo affirme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt our Lorde is the only king, the only prieſt, and the only ſaueour of the worlde, but
<pb facs="tcp:20007:146"/>
he ſhould be had by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> backe for it. For aſſone as any man confeſſed Chriſt, to be the only head of the churche, and the only ſaueour of the worlde, he was hade ſtraightwaies to priſon, and laden wyth as many fetters, as he could beare: and either he died ther miſerably (wyth the ſtynke of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) or elles he was hanged, or ſlayne, or elles burned, and ſuffred as muche torment, as could be deuiſed: ſo that the lighteſt punyſhement was to be baniſhed. And if any prince (abhorri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſuche horrible crueltie) wold not be their ſlaughterman, vpon his owne ſubiectes, by and by he began alſo to be ſuſpecte of hereſye: and was layde watche for, by theſe gaye gooſtly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. In this behalf, I reporte me to thoſe faithfull chriſtianes, that lye yet ſtill in priſon. I reporte me to the ſwordes, to the halters, and ryuers, wherwyth they were murthered moſt cruelly. I reporte me to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> galowes &amp; ſtakes in euery place, wher their dead bodies heng. I reporte me to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feldes and grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, wher an infinite nombre of them were ſlayne, for they are moo than any true chriſtian man

can thinke, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out weping teares. And yet for all this, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cruell beaſt (not contenting him ſelf to be filled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo bocherly a ſlaughter of ſayntes) whan he perceaueth, that the doctrine and faithe of Chriſt, is ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger than all his torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes &amp; punyſhementes, thought good to ſtere vp the moſt cruell peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all the worlde, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt deadly foes of the name of Germanie, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroye (w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fire &amp; ſweorde) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that take Chriſt for their only ſaueour, &amp; wil not be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to worſhip the B. of Rome, nor his God Mayzim.</p>
            <p>In this place we ought alſo to <note place="margin">Antichriſt shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sayntes.</note> marke this well (moſt louyng brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Chriſt) that the prophet Daniel ſaithe, that Antichriſt ſhall not only make batail againſt the Lordes ſayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, but alſo that he ſhal haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vpper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hande of them.

Antichriſtes ſucceſſe and victories, it muſt be vnderſtande<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodies, and externall goodes of the ſayntes, or faithfull people.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, with the amendement of life, with conſtaunt faithe, with pacience, and with continual feruent prayers: for as theſe be moſt acceptable vnto god, euen ſo their cuſtom is to burſt aſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre all the violent force that ſatan be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For theſe are the weapones, that the Lord hath deliuered vnto his churche, and he hathe promiſed to be preſent him ſelf, to aſſiſte it.

he ſeeth his enemies, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wolues y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vexe his churche: yea he not only ſeeth them, but he alſo brydleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ruleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nother dothe he ſuffre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine any farther, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſeeth it profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for vs, &amp; al his faithfull flocke.</p>

This mater is witneſſed by the vngra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cious ende of Pharao, the ſhamefull deathe of Senacherib king of the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianes, and the moſt wofull ende of many ſuche tirannes as they were.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:20007:148"/>
workes and practices: Wherby it appeareth moſt manifeſtly (as it dothe by the other ſayenges that are me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cioned before) that the B. of Rome, is that notable and mightie houge An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt, whom God wold haue reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> oracles of his worde, by Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, and the reſt of the prophetes.</p>
            <p>Now therfore, let vs paſſe ouer vnto the fifthe ſpecial poi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of that we <note place="margin">5. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtes. weapones.</hi>
               </note> haue in hande, that we maye conſidre w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what weapones Antichriſt ſhal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne, enlarge, &amp; mayntene his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And theſe it is neceſſary for vs, to haue ſkilful knowlage of, that we maye the more handſomly beware of them, and arme our ſelues the more ſtrongly againſt his tirannie. For as in feates of warre, it is a good piece of the victorie, if a man can knowe his enemies weapons, &amp; put by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrokes: euen ſo the ſame is ſpecially requiſite for vs, in this ſore fraye of Chriſt our king. And as for the hole furniture, and all the weapones, wherwith An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt dothe bothe defende him ſelf &amp; make batail againſt other, the apoſtle Paule in his ſeconde epiſtle to the Theſſalonianes comprehendeth
<pb facs="tcp:20007:149"/>
them all in fewe wordes, ſayeng that Antichriſt ſhall come after the working of ſata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with all power, and with lyeng ſignes and wondres, and with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueableneſſe of vnrighteouſneſſe,</p>
            <p>In theſe wordes we muſt note (brethren) that the apoſtle ſaithe, all Antichriſtes power, al his ſtreynght, and all his weapones ſhal be deuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe: ſo that he teacheth vs, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhall ordre all his affaires, after the working of ſathan. Therfore if we marke, what kynde a thing the <note place="margin">what the power of Sathan is</note> power of ſathan is, we ſhall alſo moſt perfitly perceaue, what Antichriſtes ſtreynght and weapones be. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit Paules wordes might ſuffice, to make this mater playne, yet let vs hear Chriſt the eternal wiſdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God the father ſpeake, which talketh thus of ſathan the prince of the worlde: He was a murtherour from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, <note place="margin">

            <p>Chriſt here comprehendeth all the ſtreynght, and all the weapones of the deuile in two kyndes: murther,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:20007:149"/>
&amp; lyeng. By this worde (Lyes) he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth <note place="margin">Lieng.</note> al that is contrarie to the truthe, and alſo his ſleightes, his gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, his falſe fraudes, and deceaueable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, aſwell in wordes &amp; dedes, as in miracles &amp; doctrine. And this terme (Murther) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyneth al wrongful vio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, <note place="margin">Murther.</note> al temerarious atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptates, al the force, al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tirannie, and all the power that men are viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly preſſed withal. And that theſe haue ben alwaies y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles tooles &amp; weapones, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by many examples, ſence the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnyng of the worlde. For thus he deceaued our furſt pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes with falſe ꝓmiſes, &amp; robbed them of paradiſe, &amp; of their bleſſed ſtate: &amp; (aſmuche as in him laye) he ſpoiled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life. And afterwarde (through murther) he made warre bi their furſt begote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Cayn, againſt true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> folowers therof: &amp; euer ſithence, he hathe ſhewed him ſelf ſuch a one, as his furſt frutes hade ſhewed, that he wolde be. Now ſeing the holy gooſt reporteth, that Antichriſt ſhal be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the deuilles weapons (Lye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and murther) it ſtandeth vs in hande to trye theſe alſo to be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> B. of Rome whom

ſcripture they haue for their trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettes, they are not aſhamed, to ſaye, that they lacke that: but they rather heape lies vpon lies, and bring out a certain new lye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g blaſphemous gloſe: Tuſhe ſaye they, al is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſcriptures, that is neceſſary for man, to obteyne ſaluacion by. As for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie of the holy gooſt, they are not afraide of it, which making anſwer to their blaſphemous ſayeng, ſpeaketh by the apoſtle S. Paule, in plaine wordes: All ſcripture geuen by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racion <note place="margin">2. <hi>Timo.</hi> 3.</note> of God, is profitable to teache, to reproue, to amende, and to informe in righteouſneſſe, that the man of God may be hole or perfite, prepared to all good workes.</p>
            <p>What can be ſpoken more cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more pithily, &amp; more euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe wordes be? The apoſtle Paule (the choſen inſtrument of God) being endued with the ſpirit of Chriſt, ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: that all the ſcripture is inſpired of God, and that therfore it is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and effectuall, not only to teache, to moniſhe and amende, but to this vſe, that alſo the man of God may be hole, perfite, and fitte to doo all thing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:20007:150"/>
that God iudgeth to be good, &amp; is good in dede. Howbeit thoſe moſt ſhameles and moſt lyeng deceauours (without reuerence to the autoritie of theſe wordes) wher they dare not denye, but the ſcripture is inſpired of God, yet they ſaye, it is vnperfite: and prate, that all thinges are not conteyned in the ſcripture, that man hathe nede of, to ſaluacion and to religion.</p>
            <p>And is God vnperfite? O ſhameles impudencie. Shall we cal that vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, which is ſet furth by god, through the ſpirit of truthe, and thinke that perfite and abſolute, which was inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the raſhe reaſon of man? But <note place="margin">Note well.</note> Paules wordes teache vs a greater mater yet, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al this. For if the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures make a man perfite &amp; fitte vnto all good workes, than can it not be a good worke, that is required, hauing <note place="margin">Good wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes.</note> non autoritie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures to beare it: &amp; therfore they ſhall neuer, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily be called good workes, which they require beſides the autoritte of the ſcriptures. Let theſe vayne hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houndes loſe and ridde them ſelues out of this knotte, if they can. But they muſt nedes fight with lyes (the
<pb facs="tcp:20007:151"/>
very owne propre weapons of ſatan) that in thus ſpeaking, they may both plucke the vnlearned rude co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, from the truthe of the ſcriptures, and alſo to tye them to the licke peny tradicions of mennes deuiſing. Yet to vttre them ſelues more openly, they doo not only ſet vp theſe kinde of lies, but alſo they fight w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> falſe tokens and lyeng wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, wherof Paule maketh mencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here, &amp; Chriſt hath bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, to beware of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For who is it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the endles heape of tokens, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> flyering friers &amp; mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng maſſeprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes were wont to prate openly of, in the papacie? For ſomtyme they feyne, that ſoules appeare, &amp; make mone vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to them, ſomtyme they declare mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought by ymages, ſomtyme they preache of wonders, wrought by the bread God of the aultare, &amp; infinit ſuche other trickes they ymagine day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wherby they maye the more eaſily cheoppe men downe, into the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of darkeneſſe, &amp; hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe ſurely, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue them once ther. Therfore (brethren) to thintent we be <note place="margin">Falſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens.</note> not begiled herein, we muſt note, that ther be falſe ſignes &amp; wonders: &amp; that,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:20007:151"/>
by two maner of falſe meanes. For furſt ther are oftentymes ſignes fey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that are falſe in dede, wherby y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is thought to be done, that is not done in dede. And of this ſorte, are ſleighty wiles, fraudes, enchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tementes, &amp; al deceaueable trickes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſimple ſoules are deceaued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>all. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dely, ther are other toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wherin it is done in dede, that we heare or ſee done: and yet it is not done, either by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> working of God, or naturally, but by the very working of the Deuil. And thoſe are worthy al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo to be called falſe tokens, &amp; lyeng wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders: bycauſe they leade me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, not into the knowlage of God, and of the truthe, but rather pul them from it, and moſt commonly they bynde men to lyes, to ydolatrie, and to ſuperſticion, or at leaſt confirme them the more ſurely, that ſet their myndes vpon ſuche fantaſies. And of this kynde of tokens, we reade partly that thoſe were, which the ſcripture ſayeth, Pharaos ſorcerers fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt Moſes and Aaron withall: and yet they were in no wyſe hable to abyde thoſe mirables, that were done, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> workyng of goddes power.
<pb facs="tcp:20007:152"/>
For like as the Deuil can not abide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maieſtie and power of God, euen ſo are not his workes hable to ſtande, in the preſence of the workes &amp; mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God. And if we will boult out the papiſtes prankes, &amp; their feyned fantaſies, we may fynde falſe tokens of bothe theſe ſortes. For how many tymes, doo theſe falſe deceaueable var<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lettes affirme thinges to be done, that were neuer done? how often doo ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſacrificeing prieſtes feyne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſoules appeare vnto them, or friers &amp; cloiſterers make lies of good ſpirites or euil ſpirites, wher as they either hunt for aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, at the ruder ſorte of peoples ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, or haue a pleaſure to ſee, how ſimple folkes be, or elles (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that colour) they ſerue their owne luſt &amp; hooriſhe filthineſſe? I reporte me to their owne dedes, entrepryſes, maners, and conſciences, and if they will ſaye truthe, they ſhall tell of ſuche knackes, as it is abominable for any man, to haue written them, and a chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtian mannes eares can not abide the hearing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And I pray you, what great towne, or what monaſterie ſhal we ſpeake of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hathe not ben aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:20007:152"/>
by one falſe and lyeng token or other? how ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue the graye friers made lies of their Franciſce? how ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue the blacke friers made lowde lies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſed virgin Mary, of Barbara, Ka<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therine, and of Chriſt our Lorde him ſelf? And among theſe, it ſhall not be farre amiſſe to recken, what a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle they haue feyned of the ſacrement of the aultare.</p>
            <p>For they ſaye, that the bread hathe chaunged his ſubſtaunce, &amp; is altred <note place="margin">The bread God the chief of all miracles.</note> in to the very ſubſtaunce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodye of Chriſt, &amp; yet the accidentes remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng ſtill: that is to ſaye, the qualitie &amp; qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine they beate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo ſhameleſly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> albeit they ſee al the ſenſes of man to denye it, and that non autoritie of the ſcripture ſerueth to their feyned fantaſie, yet they are not afraide, to make men to take it for a miracle, and to beleue it, whether they will or not.</p>
            <p>And like as theſe rakehelles are moſt nymble in forgeing of miracles. ſo they want not their other maner of lyeng wonders, which are done by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> working of the Deuil. For he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his choſen inſtrumentes, and
<pb facs="tcp:20007:153"/>
(like a diligent preaching prelate) he watcheth that he be not diſturbed of this ſo pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a tragedie: Wherby it is certain, that many wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders be done by his power. For herunto ꝑteyne the ſondry appearinges of ſpirites about graues, their mone making, their gro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ninges, their howling, their weping, &amp; alſo their fyrie facio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; horrible like<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſymple commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people hath beleued (al this while) were dead me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſoules. But whoſe this tragedie is, &amp; who is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> playour of it, it may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly be perceaued, if we marke their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuringes. For aſſone as thoſe ſpirites be coniured by a prieſt, they feyne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be ſom dead mennes ſoule, they tel what incredible paynes they abide in the fyre of purgatorie, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of their tormenting, and require helpe of their heires. And if the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be aſked, what it is, that muſt helpe them, they ſaye, a certain no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of maſſes, certayn mynnyng daies, certain meritorious praiers, &amp; certai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuche other gayre which get friers, and prieſtes money, but they plucke mennes heartes from God and from the truthe, and wrappe them in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſticious
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:20007:153"/>
and idolatrous errours. But aſſone as their heires haue done once, as the deuil moueth them to doo, ther is no more ſorowe, ther is no more mourning, ther is nomore gronyng: no, ther is no more voice he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde: and ſo the wretche people thinke they haue holpen a ſoule, that was in daungier, whan they haue done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elles, but moſt acceptable ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to the deuil.</p>
            <p>Of the ſame ſorte be the miracles, that are wrought by ymages, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be feyned by the falſe lyeng craftye conueyaunce of man, or ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp by the working of the deuil him ſelf. For ther were of the moſt famous ymages, that men beleued, ſom wept, ſom ſpake, ſom ſhifted them ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one place to an other. And ſom of them were called great wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of healing miracles, and were ſet furthe gorgeouſly with a great ſight of curſes henged about them. And bicauſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould not only tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke ſayntes for their health, &amp; other good turnes (which was wicked ynough of it ſelf) we are ſure, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they gaue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to ſai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> places &amp; ymages,
<pb facs="tcp:20007:154"/>
which they were worſhipped in. By <note place="margin">Ther were ſuche ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es pleyntie in Englan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de, beſides roodes, &amp; many other.</note> reaſon wherof, they ſayed that our lady of Aquen wrought one miracle, our lady of Laurete an other, our lady of the wood an other, and our lady of Regenſburigh an other: tuſhe ther be other miracles beſides theſe that I reckoned vp, a great deale more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be wondred at: howbeit I dare not ſaye, whether our poſteritie will geue credite to them or not. For I haue ſene (with in the tyme of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce) men in a great ſodayn (not purpoſing any ſuch thing afore) re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne as faſte as their fete could beare them, and as if they hade ben out of their wittes, three or foure myles to an ymage, and ther lye proſtrate .ij. or .iij. houres together, as if they hade ben half dead, and than come to their mynde again, and ſo riſe vp and com (fayre and manerly) home.</p>
            <p>This mater is more newe, and ouer lately done, than to be denyed. At Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſburgh ther was a lady (that was muche ſpoken of for this kynde of miracle) whom they called Our ladie of beautie, trymmed with a crowne and a regal ſceptre more like Iuno
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:20007:154"/>
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bleſſed virgin Mary. But what nede we to make many wordes about this mater, ſeing all men knowe, that ther was exceding great pleyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſuche maner of miracles, in eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry place: which not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding were lyes, as a man may perceaue clearely by this one argument, that what feate ſo euer they attempted to doo, was cleane contrary to the trade of Goddes worde.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuche as al men are not <note place="margin">Antichriſt fighteth! wyth open force.</note> ſo ignoraunt &amp; blynde, that all doo ſuffre them ſelues to be deceaued and blynded, wyth this furſt ſweorde of Antichriſt, that is, lies and falſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: Paule aſcribeth vnto him that other ſweorde of ſathan alſo, that is, open violent force and power to doo wrong, wherwyth he may openly laye vpon them, that reſiſte him, and oppreſſe and make them to couche, that ſpeake againſt him. And this we may ſee, as playnly in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes of Rome, as we doo their lies and falfe craftes. For furſt, they are furniſhed well ynough, wyth their owne ſtreynght, and their owne power. They haue great cities
<pb facs="tcp:20007:155"/>
obedient at their commaundement. They haue great countreyes, and great menne vnder their ſubiection and autoritie, they haue great hoſtes of valeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and wel furniſhed warlike me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they haue alſo harneſſe and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pones for the warres, and al that can be required vnto marciall affaires, and to make warres withal: yea they not only haue them, but alſo they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie them openly, againſt kynges, princes, cities, and people, that refuſe to be vnder their ſubiection, and dare be ſo hardy, as to withſtande their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes. Notwithſtanding, bicauſe they haue perceaued (by experience) the chaunce of warres to be vncertain, and doubtfull, the myſchieuous ſubtil helhoundes haue made them newe kynde of armour, and a newe ſweor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, ſo kene, that they haue ſtrike<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt mightie kinges and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours with the edge of it: Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municacion I meane, which a man may call rather a thonderbolt, that they vſe to ſtrike and to curſe ſuche princes withall, as be not their fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and to depryue them of their princely dignities; and whan they
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:20007:155"/>
haue put downe them, to ſet other in their places. And to thintent their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannye ſhould want nothing, they haue made their power ſo ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, wyth other mennes marcial force, that they neuer myſſed of ſom, either princes or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people, which were content to put their iudgementes &amp; ſentences in execucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, againſt ſuche as were ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies of the ſea of Rome, &amp; to haſarde them ſelues in moſt daungerous war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res for the mayntenaunce of it. Of this tirannie (ioyned with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full muche politike falſhead) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Greke Emperours felt their parte. For the B. of Rome procured the Lumbardes in to Italie, to make warres vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, till he hade wiped them beſides the Empire of al Italie. And yet the lum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bardes them ſelues taſted of the like falſhead and tirannie. For whan they beganne to wexe to ſore vpon the Biſhoppes of Rome, and to couet the empire of Italie and Rome: wher the Biſhop durſt not meddle wyth them him ſelf, he calleth the Frenche kinges to helpe him, by whoſe power he furſt repreſſed the Lumbardes, and at laſt he ouerlaide them ſo by
<pb facs="tcp:20007:156"/>
Charles the great, that he lefte them nothing of their realme, which they hade kept in poſſeſſion .CC. yeares, ſaue only the bare name. And in our tyme we haue ſene the B. of Rome doo to muche wronge, to the Frenche men. For he droue them alſo (after his owne practiced maner) by other mennes power, namely by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> armies of the Heluecianes, at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tyme out of al Italie. In dede theſe are the craftye trickes of this bawdye hoore of Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, yea ſhe is ſo connyng in theſe wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye knackes, and can brewe madde loue cuppes ſo fynely, that ſhe can get her louers in euery countrey, ſo truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſo conſtraunt, that they wil not ſticke to put their owne lyues in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarde, ſo they may defende and mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene her maiſtreſſhip.</p>

forme of the othe, lately preſcribed vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the emperour Ottho, and as it is ſomwhat more euidently recorded in other of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> popes owne Canones. For in the <hi>Extrauagauntes, Com. li.</hi> 1. <hi>Tit. De Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioritate &amp; obedientia,</hi> he writeth thus.</p>
            <p>We are taught by the wordes of the Goſpel, that in this churche (meanyng the churche of Chriſt, which he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche of Rome) and in the power of the ſame, ther be twoo ſweordes, a ſpirituall ſweorde, and a temporall, ſweorde. For wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſaide, Lo, here are two ſweordes, that is to ſaye, in the churche: the Lorde anſwered them not that they were to many, but ynowe. Doubtles he that denyeth the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral ſweorde to be in Pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tres power, dothe marke euil the worde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lord ſpeaketh: Put vp thy ſweord again in to the ſcaberde. Therfore the churche hath power of both ſweordes: that is to ſaye, the ſpirituall ſweorde, &amp; the material ſweorde. But the material ſweord muſt be exercited for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche, &amp; the ſpiritual ſweorde of the churche. The ſpiritual ſweorde is in the prieſtes owne hande, and the material ſweorde in the hande of kinges and knyghtes:
<pb facs="tcp:20007:157"/>
howbeit at the appointement and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feraunce of the prieſt.</p>
            <p>Marke here now (brethren) Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtes external power, and his bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy murthering ſweorde, which the B. of Rome chalengeth to him ſelfe by ſo playne wordes, hauyng no grounded reaſon of the ſcriptures, but wraſteth them ſo blaſphemouſly &amp; ſo violently. For he ſayth, ther be two ſweordes in the churche, that is the Eccleſiaſticall power, &amp; the Emperours power: &amp; he maketh them bothe ſubiecte to the B. of R. And he ſayeth, that they miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande Chriſtes wordes, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye the Emperours power to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte to the B. of Romes pleaſure. And herein (in dede) the beaſt ſayeth moſte true. For they that denye this, do the greateſt diſpleaſure that can be to the ſea of Rome, while they wolde ſet the Emperours power at libertie, &amp; wype the ſea of Rome beſyde ſo great auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, to appoint and commaunde.</p>
            <p>But let it ſuffice vs, to haue learned thus muche hereout, that it is out of queſtion, that the B. of Rome hathe ſnatched to him ſelfe, that other kynde of Antichriſtes weapones. And what

nede we to beate any longer vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this mater, ſeyng experience telleth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I ſaye the truthe? For is not the Emperours ſweord drawen now at the B. of Romes berke? Doth it not rage and make hauocke (alreadye) of the Lordes ſaintes?

For ſeing all maner of vnthankfulneſſe is odious before God, and worthy of

            <p>This mater hathe exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples ynowe, in euery place of the ſcriptures. Yet the moſt notable and moſt horrible ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ample hereof is in Pharao. For while he did not only not receaue nor allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we the truthe of Goddes worde, &amp; the moſt holſom warnynges of God, but alſo reiecte them wyth an vnthankful heart, and wyth threattenyng &amp; blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous wordes, he was caſt in to ſo great a folye and blyndeneſſe, by the iuſt iudgement of God: that he could not conſidre his preſent miſerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but threwe him ſelf and his, in a wilful luſt of wickedneſſe, head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in to the rageing reade ſea.

the falſe prophetes, he falleth in to <g ref="char:abpre">p̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſtruction. The like iudgement of the righteous God fell vpon al Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, whan they were ſeduced wyth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lies of the falſe prophetes, in the daies of king Zedechias and of the prophet Ieremie, while they renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous monicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lorde God.

For while the people mynding to gratifie the B. of Rome, were better content to receaue the vſe of ymages, and to be inſtructed and taught by them, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mater of Chriſtian faithe, and of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life, than by the holy ſcriptures, they were taught ſuche leſſones by their ymages, as the deuil is vſed to teache his ſcholares (I meane) ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticion, abominable and wicked God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruice: and ther vpon (as the caſe was amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Idolaters in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes paſt) ther folowed al kynde of vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce &amp; wickedneſſe, yea &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> errour (by lit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tel and littel) crept vp ſo high, that at lenght we were made ſubiectes to An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſtes yowke in al maters, &amp; were

            <p>IN theſe other foure Homilies (louing brethren in Chriſt) I haue hitherto playnly declared thoſe ſcriptures, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſerue to knowe the feate, the ſpringing vp, the perſone, the workes, and the weapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Antichriſt by: which if they be compared with the ſeate, ſtarting vp, perſone, workes, and weapones of the biſhop of Rome, we muſt nedes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that what ſo euer is ſpoken of Antichriſt, by the prophet Daniel, and the apoſtle S. Paule, agreeth rightly with the B. of Rome, in euery condicion. And therfore this muſt of neceſſitie folowe, that the B. of Rome (which delyteth to be named the head of the churche; Chriſtes vicare, the portour of heauen gate, yea and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelf) is that vndoubted and mightie houge enemie of our ſaueour
<pb facs="tcp:20007:165"/>
Chriſt: that is to ſaye, Antichriſt, the manne of ſynne, the ſonne of perdici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; that highe abominacion, whiche neſtleth his ſeate in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of God, and exalteth him ſelfe, aboue al that is named God: in that he (to muche ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely) taketh that vpon him ſelfe, which belongeth to none, but to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only grace and power of God.</p>
            <p>Nowe remayneth the laſt mater, which maketh mencion of the fal and deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Antichriſt, which alſo is to be knowen, by the places before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed, wherof we may ſucke not on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly excellent good learnyng, but alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceadyng muche comforte.</p>
            <p>But the Apoſtle Paule (ſpeaking of the ende &amp; deſtruction of this vngra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <note place="margin">The ende and deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</note> &amp; wicked monſtre) ſayeth: The Lorde ſhal deſtroy him with the breathe of his mouthe, &amp; ſhall deſpeche him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the brightneſſe &amp; glorie of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming: that is to ſaye, at his bright &amp; glorious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. Two thinges therfore the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle wold haue vs to note, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Antichriſt. Furſt he ſayeth, that he muſt be deſtroyed and ſlayne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breath of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lordes mouth: which ſaieng is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of Eſay, as I
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:20007:165"/>
ſayd a litel before. For Eſay ſpeaking of Chriſt our Lorde &amp; of his workes, re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porteth the ſelf ſame mater, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very ſame wordes. And ther we muſt more depely marke the meanyng of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, <note place="margin">Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed with the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the of the Lordes mouthe.</note> wherby we maye the more eaſely vnderſtande, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe are alſo fulfilled. The breathe of the Lordes mouthe, is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eternall &amp; almightie worde of God, by the which it is manifeſt, that al cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>atures were made at the beginnyng of the worlde, &amp; are conſerued eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this daye. And this worde (y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle ſayeth) ſhal be the ſweorde, wherwith Antichriſt muſt nedes be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>And in dede the ſame Apoſtle calleth the worde of God a ſwcorde, writyng thus to the Hebrewes in the. 4. Chap. The worde of God is quicke and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in operacion, &amp; ſharper than any two edged ſweorde, and pearceth through euen vnto the diuiding aſondre of the ſoule and the ſpirite, and of the ioyntes and the marye, and iudgeth the though<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes and intentes of the hearte.</p>
            <p>Surely they that haue their ſynnes opened, &amp; reproued by this worde, per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceaue by experience, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is ſuche a ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner of ſweorde in dede. Furthermore
<pb facs="tcp:20007:166"/>
whan the ſame apoſtle armeth vs, and trymmeth vs againſt our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon enemye, he reacheth vs the ſweorde of the ſpirite, which is the worde of God, wherwith Chriſt our ſaueour him ſelf hathe taught vs to fight, by his owne example. For wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſatha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (that wicked temptour) came to him being, as he was very man in dede, Chriſt dothe warde and ſtryke by all Satanes blowes, with this one only ſweorde, holding out (againſt euery aſſault of temptacion) ſuche fitte tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of goddes worde, as he might put him to flight, and breake his weapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes withall. Wherfore ſeing we ſee the deuil him ſelf ouercomen with Goddes worde long agoo, we ſhall thinke, that Paule hade good mater to ſaye &amp; teache vs, that Antichriſt (the choſen inſtrument of the deuill) ſhall alſo be ouercome and deſtroyed with the breathe of Goddes mouthe: that is, by the worde of God. But the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie of this ſentence we muſt more depely ſearche out.</p>
            <p>Paule in the ſame place (treating of Antichriſtes weapones and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes) ſaid, that his power and working
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:20007:166"/>
ſhal be deuilliſhe, &amp; that being trym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye furniſhed in falſe wyles and lies, he ſhall doo all that the prophetes reporte of him, yea that he ſhall reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne (like a king) in mennes conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, through the power of lies. For ther wolde neuer a man in all the worlde receaue ſo haynous an abominacion, that knewe perfitly what it were. But foraſmuche as he crepeth in to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes conſciences with wylie craftes and falſe ſleightes, he diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bleth him ſelf to be an other maner a felowe, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is in dede: Yea by the reaſon of falſe citing and expounding of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſcriptures, he knoweth the caſt, howe to couer his monſtrous face. Anone after, they (whome with his falſe doinges he hathe made tame fooles) haue once receaued him, he reigneth &amp; ruleth the roſt in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, after ſuche ſorte, that they geue credence to him, and doo what ſo euer he biddeth them, and refuſe what ſo euer he forbiddeth them: yea they paſſe their tyme being all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addicte to hym.</p>
            <p>Now ſeing all Antichriſtes tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and emperious kingdome hathe
<pb facs="tcp:20007:167"/>
none other ſure foundacion, but only lyes and falſe craftes, it muſt nedes haue a downefall alſo, aſſone as the lyght of Goddes worde, that is, the lyght of eternall truthe ſhyneth into mennes conſciences, and reproueth craftye ſleyghtes and lyes. For it is not poſſible for men to geue credence to lyes any more, which knowe them to be lyes, but it maketh them rather to be abaſhed, to be ſo ſhamefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued: and to beare a deadly hate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do amyſſe, by their deceauyng. Than therfore Antichriſt hathe loſt bothe his lyfe &amp; his royaltie, through the ſweorde of Goddes worde, albeit he lyue yet ſtill in bodye, and reigne ſtill in very many of his membres. But that we maye perceaue this gayre more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, we muſt note the mater it ſelf: that is, how it dothe fittlye accorde to the condicion of the B. of Rome.</p>
            <p>Whan the biſhop of Rome began to be deſirous to beare the bell, he ſet out himſelf &amp; al his purpoſes, for men to ſee, not to be ſuche as they were in dede, but painted &amp; floriſhed ouer with ſondry countrefait colours. For at the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:20007:167"/>
furſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſimple rude co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people muſt nedes be perſuaded that Petre had the ſupremacie, yea y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> principalitie among Chriſtes Apoſtles, &amp; at leynght was brought to Rome, and there preached the Goſpel, and that he was the furſt biſhop of the church of Rome. By this reaſon the ſupremacie of other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches myght be tranſlated to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche of Rome, &amp; this might be obteyned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al, that the B. of R. is the head &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall biſhop of all the churche, as he that being ſucceſſour of Petre, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the apoſtles, &amp; Chriſtes vicare, hath his ſea in the principall churche. And bycauſe this ſo ambicious and licke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peny lieng gloſe ſhoulde not lacke his countrefait colour, theſe arrogaunt ſawcy helhou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des haue brought furth places of ſcripture violentlye &amp; wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedly wraſted for their purpoſe. And where as we reade, that Chriſte ſayd to Petre, whan he confeſſed him to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of God: Thou art Petre, and vpon this rocke will I buylde my churche: They ſayde, Chriſtes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des are thus to be vnderſtanden, that Chriſt made Petre the foundacion of hys churche, and that al churches
<pb facs="tcp:20007:168"/>
are bounden therfore of duetie to be vnder the obedience of Petres ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour, the B. of Rome. Againe wher the Lorde ſaithe, Petre fede my ſhepe, theſe men haue expounded this worde (fede) ſo, that they wold nedes haue the autoritie and ſupremacie of all bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes and churches geuen to the B. of Rome, as vnto Petres ſucceſſour. They haue alſo violently wraſted this vnto the ſame purpoſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the keyes, ſayth: What ſo euer thow ſhalt bynde in earthe, ſhal be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in heauen: and what ſo euer thow ſhalt loſe on earthe, ſhal be loſed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. For they ſaide, whom ſo euer ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the B. of Rome him ſelf or any other ſacrificeing prieſt (being conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by the B. of Romes autoritie) aſſoiled, was loſed and ridde from the bondes of ſynnes: and contrary wiſe that vnto whom ſo euer that maner of abſolucion was denyed, he was bounden ſtill in the cheynes of ſynne, and in the ſtate of damnacion. Theſe toyes (I ſaye) and infinite other haue the ſubtil ſleighty marchauntes bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in to the eares and heartes of the common ſimple ſorte. And as ſone as
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:20007:168"/>
theſe maters beganne once to growe in to credence, men beganne alſo to taſte of the B. of Romes power and tirannye. For if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hade ſo good a ſtomacke, that he durſt ſet his fote either againſt the B. of Rome or his, he was ſtraightwaies knocked in the head, with the thonderbolt of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municacion, and reputed of all men for a damned and an vndone man: and thus the mater growed ſo farre furthe, that euen moſt mighty empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours began to be afraide of the B. of Romes power. For they ſpared not emperours, but ſhotte of their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce at them alſo, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſtraitly vnder great paynes, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould obey thoſe emperours, that were excommunicate: as it is to ſee in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chronicles of the greke empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, &amp; by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnworthy falles of the emperours, He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>. 4, &amp;. 5. Lewis y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>. 4. &amp; Friderike y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>. 1. &amp;. 2. And doubtles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they did (w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t forſight) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhoppes of Rome, &amp; entred Italie ſondry tymes, with roiall ſtrong armies, &amp; droue their enemies y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhoppes of Rome out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> title, &amp; ſet others in their row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
<pb facs="tcp:20007:169"/>
yet all their trauailes were vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne &amp; to no purpoſe, nother were they hable to twytche awaye ſo muche as one heare of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhoppes cruel viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, nor to pul it vnder any whitte at all. For as ſone as their backs were once turned, &amp; departed Italie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhoppes of Rome came in to the citie again, &amp; occupied their loſt tirannye afreſhe, and with the thonderclappes of their curſe, they made the Emperours fayne to be obedient vnto them. And the only cauſe of this miſchief was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the B. of Rome was not yet dead in mennes conſciences: bicauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued, that he was Chriſtes vicare, &amp; hade power to loſe &amp; bynde, yea &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ouer heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; hel to. Therfore the ſtreinght &amp; power of emperours was neuer hable to preuaile or bring any thing to paſſe againſt the craftye doi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges &amp; force of the biſhoppes of Rome. For although emperours the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues &amp; other of their courtes &amp; houſeholdes eſpied y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> romiſhe fraudes &amp; deceueable wiles wel ynough, yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vulgare peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the B. of Romes decrees ought to be honoured as the lawes of God: and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:20007:169"/>
bicauſe they dradde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thonderclappes of his curſe, as though they hade ben the fearfull ſentences of the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, they wold nother meddle nor be of counſail with ſuche, as they ſawe knocked downe with the lait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolte of excommunicacion. And this the biſhoppes of Rome could the eaſylier bring to paſſe, bicauſe ther were biſhoppes and doctours of chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſcatred throughout al the coaſtes of chriſtendom, which ſet furthe the autoritie of the churche of Rome, for apoſtolike and godly.</p>
            <p>But now let vs ſpeake alſo of ſuch maters, as haue chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced in our tyme, that we maye ſee, how Paul y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles prophecie is fulfilled at this daye. At ſuch tyme as it pleaſed God our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly and mercifull bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teous father, to ſet his people at libertie, which had ben long holden in bondage, and to brydle Antichriſtes tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie, he choſed the ſmall veſſelles and ſuch as were of no reputacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſemed moſt mightie &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible. For two or thre faithful doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours &amp; miniſtres of churches being enlumined w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſpirit of God, whan
<pb facs="tcp:20007:170"/>
they were growne to more perfite knowlage of the ſcriptures, vttred o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly the breathe of the Lordes mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, that is to ſaye, the worde of God, and weaponed many a one with the ſame ſharpe ſtrong ſweord. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men hade once goten that weapon in their handes (to kepe their heades a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the craftye wiles of the falſe prophetes) they began to acknowlage Ieſus Chriſt, and to beleue, that he is the only head of his churche, the chief prieſt and king, the ſufficient ſacrifice for the ſynnes of the worlde, and the only mediatour and aduocate wyth the heauenly father, yea and ſuch a one that is neuer abſent from his churche, and nedeth not the ſeruice of any vicare in his rowme. And in dede the knowlage of theſe maters dothe alſo reproue the lies and legier de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mayne of the B. of Rome, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they might ſee on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other parte, that he is nother the head of the churche, nor the high prieſt and king, &amp; muche leſſe the vicare of Chriſt our ſaueour. They haue moreouer learned, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maſſe is no ſacrifice for ſynnes, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> popiſhe abſolucion is of any autoritie.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:20007:170"/>
Furthermore thoſe places of ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re which the biſhoppes of Rome (like moſt ſhameles helhoundes) hade vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, wickedly, and ſawcely wraſted, were plainly opened in their owne true meanyng, whan the light of the truthe was laide to them. And out of thoſe places men learned, that Petre is not the rocke it ſelf, but that he hade his denominacion of Petra, that is the rocke, whiche he confeſſed, <note place="margin">Chriſt is the Rocke, and not Petre.</note> and ſo they acknowlaged, that Chriſt is the rocke, which is the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacion of the churche, wherupon the churche of faithfull people (being ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely buylt) can not ſwarue, 1. Cor. 3. Men haue learned alſo, that the office of feding ſignifieth not an empire or a kingdome, but the office of teaching, moniſhing, exhortyng, reprouing, cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>recting and comforting, which be all comprehended in the miniſterie of the worde: which as it manifeſtly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Matth. 28. was not committed to Petre alone, but to all the apoſtles w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. This is alſo manifeſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lorde neuer graunted vnto Petre the apoſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le any ſupremacie ouer the reſt of his diſciples, but that he rather repreſſed
<pb facs="tcp:20007:171"/>
(with ſore ſharpe wordes) al their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicion and deſire of rule bearing, if they began once to be ouercomen w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the infirmitie of the fleſhe, and ſtryue who ſhould be chief, aboue the reſt. Matth. 18. 20. Luc. 22. Io. 13.</p>
            <p>Concerning the keyes, it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared alſo, that they ſignifie not <note place="margin">what the keyes ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie.</note> the thonderbolt of the popes curſe, or his pelting pardones, but the vertue and power of the goſpell and worde of God, which proclaymeth forgeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſynnes, to all them that truſt faithfully in Chriſt, and are hartily re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pentaunt for their ſynnes: and it ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vp and confirmeth their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, with the promiſes of God. And on the contrary parte, it threatteneth the puniſhement of euerlaſting dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion, to them that are vnfaithfull, and can not repent</p>
            <p>Theſe maters and infinite others ſuch like, whan men hade learned by the light of Goddes worde: and on the other parte, whan they therby hade once eſpied y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> B. of Romes ſleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty iuggling, deceates, and lies: than was Antichriſt ſlayne wyth the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the of the Lordes mouthe, and laye
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:20007:171"/>
dead in their conſciences. For after that tyme, they paſſed not vpon him, but beganne to eſteme his bleſſinges for curſinges, and his curſinges for bleſſinges: as for the thonderboltes of his excommunicacion, they laught them to ſcorne, and reckoned all his power to be nothing elles, but wicked and blaſphemous tirannie. Therfore as Golias was (in the olde worlde) vnder Dauid, ſo doo we ſee, that the B. of Rome is now ſlayne wyth his owne ſweord, I meane, with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame places of ſcripture, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which (being miſerably and violently wraſted) he hath eſtabliſhed his tirannie.</p>
            <p>And thus we ſee it truly fulfilled, that the Apoſtle Paule (being inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red wyth the ſpirite of Chriſt) ſpake before hande concerning Antichriſt. For although he rage horriblye in his membres, and bluſtre out threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teninges and tho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derclappes, yet thoſe people are nothing moued with his procedinges, which are true faithfull chriſtianes in dede, and haue their Biſhop, king and prieſt, and their only head and mediatour in hauen,
<pb facs="tcp:20007:172"/>
vnto whom (hauing their myndes lifted vp vnto thoſe thinges that are in heauen) they doo obey, and paſſe not a pynne of the popes maſking vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, nor the procedinges of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hoore of Babilon, for all that ſhe is roſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured with many a ſayntes blood.</p>
            <p>Now vnto this furſt parte, Paule <note place="margin">Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt shal be deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched at the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng.</note> addeth alſo the other poynt, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Antichriſtes deſtruetion: and ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he ſhall vtterly be deſpeched at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng of our ſaueour Chriſt. This he dothe ſpeake of the laſt daye, and final iudgement whan Chriſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of God and of Mary ſhall geue vnreuocable ſentence, vpon all fleſhe: and thus the Apoſtles mynde is to teache vs, with what iudgement An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtes wickedneſſe ſhal be than pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: and that Daniel the prophet dothe more pleyntifully, and more clearely deſcribe in theſe wordes. I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked till the ſeates were prepared, &amp; till <note place="margin">

This are we taught not only by ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles reporting this mater, but ther are vnfallible reaſonos of this ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce conteyned in the worde of God, and in the holy articles of our faithe. For we learne by bothe, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only waye, the only doore, and gate of ſaluacion, wherby we may entre in to the kingdome of heauen. Furthermore they teache vs, that Chriſt Ieſus is the only head of his churche, the only and chief prieſt, the only ſacrifice for the ſynnes of the worlde, and the only mediatour and aduocate vnto God the father for ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Hereof we haue teſtimonies occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt in euery place of the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.

Petre ſpeaking of Chriſt before the prieſtes, Act. 4. ſaithe: This is the ſtone, that was refuſed of you builders which is the chief of the corner, and ther is ſaluacion in non other.

            <p>Hereof than this muſt nedes fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that we muſt recken them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly caſt awaye from ſaluacion, and (as Iohan baptiſt ſayeth) vnder the wrathe of God, that will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in him.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:20007:175"/>
the ſcriptures purporte hym to be. But that ſhalt thou neuer doo, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhalt be hable to doo, yf thou wilt folowe the biſhop of Rome, and recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue his faythe and doctrine.

Finally with what faithe ſhalt thow acknowlage Chriſt to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only waye of ſaluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the doore of true bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, if thou ſtryue to goo to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> merites of thyne owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay, by faſting, ſhryuing, maſſes, ſtaciones, and by the protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and aide of popiſhe bulles and pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or by broiling in the burnyng colle pitte of the popes purgatorie.</p>
            <p>Doeſt thow not ſee, that this gaire is cleane contrary repugnau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to that faithe, which teacheth vs to ſticke to Chriſt alone? Therfore thow muſt of neceſſitie confeſſe, that thow canneſt not choſe, but be moſt farre of, from beleuing faithfully in Chriſt, if thow wilt folowe the doctrine of the B. of Rome, and embrace the faithe that he ſetteth furthe. And if thow be voide of faithfull beleuing in Chriſt, doubtles the wrathe of God abideth vpon thee, in that thow wilt not geue credence to the ſonne of God. So that in caſe

thow goo on ſtill in thy infidelitie once receaued, and contynue ſtill a membre of the popiſhe faith, and of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> popiſhe churche: thow canneſt loke for non other iudgement, but to be caſt with thy head, Antichriſt, at the laſt daye, in to vnque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceable fire. For here appeareth no maner of meane for vs, but either we muſt be ſaued by him, which only hathe ſaluacion in him felf, or be excluded from him, and be damned for euer more.</p>
            <p>Therfore the papiſtical faithe and religion muſt not be reckoned a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain light ignoraunce and tryfling errour, which thow maieſt eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, nother muſt we beleue, that any man in all the world can be ſaued, in caſe he ſticke ſtubbernly vnto it.

And therfore the mercifull and moſt gentill harted doctour of all the worlde Ieſus Chriſt, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth vs in al other thinges, ſo he

            <p>I knowe what many will obiecte againſt me, in this behalf: if thow <note place="margin">Note well.</note> make all them damned (ſay they) that folowe the trade of Antichriſt, that is, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> B. of Rome, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt our fathers &amp; auncetours nedes be damned alſo.</p>
            <p>In dede this is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon querel of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papiſtes, which they are alwaies prating and beating in to the rude &amp; vnlearned common peoples heades, and trouble many folkes myndes therwithall: which thinke it were a moſt vnworthye mater for them to beleue, that their elders were the children of damnacion. And this their meanyng is to gather hereof,
<pb facs="tcp:20007:178"/>
that if our auncettours, which lyued vnder the popiſhe religion, were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: than they may be ſaued by the ſame meanes alſo. As for me, I will ſpeake ſomwhat ſobrely of theſe maters, nother will I ſearche, nor rippe the iudgementes of God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely. For to what purpoſe were it, to ſearche, what maner of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God vſed towardes our aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cettours, which departed this life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for the truthe came to light? Howbeit touching his grace and mercie, we will not hope but the beſt in euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion: namely ſeing it were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him, to lighten them (that erred and were deceaued with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ignoraunce) euen at the laſt breathe of their life, that they might acknowlage &amp; receaue the true faithe in Chriſt, and ſo be ſaued. But in the meane ſpace, this we are ſure of, that if they were ſaued (as we truſt they were) they were ſaued by non other reaſon nor waye, but by the merite of Chriſt, and not by the helpe of popiſhe ſuperſticion. Ther is no cauſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, why you ſhould goo about to clooke your errours and ſuperſticion,

For ther is no like compariſon, nor agrement in them.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the abominable, cruel, &amp; peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous tyrannye of Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondely, this is to be noted (lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing brethren in Chriſt) that by Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſayeng, Antichriſt ſhall endure, til the laſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng of Chriſt vnto iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; reigne by one maner or other. For albeit he be dead flayne by the breathe of Goddes mouthe, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſweord of Goddes worde in many fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, yet he lyueth (through his ſleightes &amp; falſe wiles) in many <note place="margin">Antichriſt abideth til the Lord's commyng</note> peoples heartes yet ſtill, and bicauſe he abuſeth their power againſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full chriſtianes, he ſtereth vp batail continually.</p>
            <p>Therfore we ſhall neuer be quyte ridde of him for good &amp; all, as long as
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:20007:179"/>
the worlde abideth in this ſtate: but he ſhal alwaies haue ſeruauntes and complices of his owne, to rage &amp; playe the tyranne againſt vs withall. So that it ſtandeth vs in hande, to watche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually, and fight (like tal felowes) night and daye, that he ouercome vs not, and pull vs vnder his fete.</p>
            <p>Now brethren we haue ſene the hole myſterie of that mighty houge Antichriſt. We haue ſene, that the B. of Rome is only worthy of this name and title, and ought to be taken for Antichriſt. We haue ſene, how great &amp; haynous his abominacion is, and how perilous a thing his religion is. We ſhall therfore geue thankes vnto God, from the botom of our heartes, in that he hath vouchedſafe to reueale vnto vs ſo great an enemye. &amp; to open his falſe ſnares vnto vs. And we ſhall pray vnto God alſo, that it will pleaſe him to defende vs, wyth the protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his grace, from all this enemies ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
            <p>Now remayneth the laſt, &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full admonicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, wherby he teacheth vs diligently, what we ought to doo in this laſt tyme of Antichriſt.
<pb facs="tcp:20007:180"/>
For wher he hathe declared, that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riles ſhall aryſe hereof, he warneth vs to beware of them, in theſe wordes.</p>
            <p>Than if they ſhall ſaye vnto you, Lo <note place="margin">

For like as the lightenyng cometh from the caſte, and ſhyneth in to the weſt: euen ſo ſhall the commyng of the ſonne of man be. For wher ſo euer the dead carcaſſe is, ther alſo ſhall the eagles reſorte.</p>
            <p>In theſe wordes (moſt louing bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Chriſt) we are taught three thinges, which it is conuenient for vs (during the reigne of Antichriſt) not only to knowe, but alſo to folowe. And furſt he repeteth the ſame that he hade ſpoken before, and biddeth vs be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leue <note place="margin">Beleue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not.</note> them not, that ſaye, Chriſt is here or there: that is to ſaye, that goo about to ſhewe vs a falſe Chriſt, or tel vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the giftes of God, which are geuen vs by non, but by only Chriſt, are to be hade elles where. Now that we may vnderſtande &amp; folowe this warnyng, as we ſhould doo, it is neceſſary for vs to call to remembraunce, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſayen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that are ſpoken in the Homilies
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:20007:180"/>
before, bothe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true Chriſt, I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, the only ſaueour of this worlde, &amp; alſo of the falſe Chriſtes. He is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true Chriſt, whom the autoritie of the holy ſcripture deſcribeth to be very God and very ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the only ſaueour of the worlde, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only prieſt, the only ſacrifice for the ſynnes of the worlde, yea the only head of the churche, and mennes interceſſour in heauen. As many tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſhewe this Chriſt any wher elles, than in heauen: as many as appoint other heades of the churche, other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demers of the worlde, other ſacrifices for the ſynnes of the worlde, and other aduocates, interceſſours, and media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, are comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Chriſt: and thoſe be euen they, whom it is not laufull for vs to bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, or to geue credence vnto. And this is ſo openly done in the papacie, of the pope him ſelf and his membres, that no man can ſay naye to it. For furſt, they are not wont to ſhewe Chriſt our Lorde in heauen, which was crucified for vs, and died, which roſe again, and aſcended in to heauen, according to the articles of the apoſtles Crede: but to tell folkes, that he is either
<pb facs="tcp:20007:181"/>
conteyned in a prety litel white cake, or in churches conſecrated for that purpoſe, which they are not afraide to dreſſe with theſe written wordes: <hi>Hic Deum adora.</hi> Here worſhip God.</p>
            <p>Are not theſe they than, that ſhewe Chriſt our Lorde in cloſettes or ſecret places, as he hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelf told before ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de? As we will ſpeake nothing, how their vſe is to teach vs a farre other Chriſt, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is purported in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcriptures, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures beare recorde, that he was only incarnate, &amp; made very ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our ſakes. But theſe men not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting them ſelues with that, feyne him alſo to be impanate or embrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Yea and they ymagine him to be ſuch a one, that he may be called eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry daye in to a piece of breade, by the prieſtes enchauntementes, as though he were a certain new <hi>Elicius Iupiter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, if they purpoſe to ſpeake of thoſe thinges, that Chriſt our Lorde hathe purchaced with the merite of his owne death, as of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion of ſynnes, the grace of God the fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, iuſtice, right of adopcion, and the poſſeſſion of euerlaſting bleſſedneſſe: than their maner is (with ſuch open

wickedneſſe &amp; ſhameleſneſſe) to ſhewe them elles where, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Chriſt alone, that they can not denie it, though they wolde neuer ſo fayne. The Apoſtle Paule ſayeth, that Chriſt is made of <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>and.</hi> 2.</note> God vnto vs, wyſedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, righteouſnes, ſanctificacion, &amp; redempcion: &amp; that he knewe nothing els, but Ieſus Chriſt, euen him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was crucified. And in an other place declaring the certaintie of his doctrine, he ſayeth: Although we <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal,</hi> 1.</note> or an Angel from heauen ſhall preache vnto you any other goſpel, than that we haue preached vnto you, curſed be he. But we heare the popiſhe ſhauelinges &amp; greaſye doctours preache a farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maner of Goſpell, than the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles haue ſent vnto vs in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges. For they teache righteouſnes to be in mennes owne workes &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. They teache folkes, to ſeke for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geueneſſe of ſynnes, at the handes of wicked, and hooremonging, yea moſt filthie rakehell maſſe prieſtes. As for the grace and fauour of god, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it (againſt Goddes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) vnto ymages, that they ſet vp: and therfore they vſe to name them, gracious, as Our lady of grace, &amp; ſuch

other. Tuſhe, yf a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold recken vp al the hole dong hil of popiſhe religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnto theſe, he ſhal ſee that they aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be al that is neceſſary vnto ſaluation, to externall toyes and trifles.</p>
            <p>And wher the ſcriptures ſhewe vs, one only patron &amp; mediatour, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, very God &amp; very man: they haue deuiſed as many mediatours, patrones, and interceſſours beſides him, as they beleue ther be ſayntes ſoules in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore wil we, nyl we: we muſt nedes ſaye, that they be the ſame, that the redemour &amp; vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable ſcholemaiſter of the worlde maketh mencion of, in this place.</p>
            <p>What muſt we doo now in this behalfe, you me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and brethren? Chriſt ſaithe, Beleue them not. Lo, our ſaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our geueth a ſhorte, ſymple, &amp; playne commaundement, which is a preſent medicine againſt all the obiectiones, that man can deuiſe. Thow ſhalt take them to be deceauours, as many as goo about to bring in this maner of doctrine, and therfore thow ſhalt not beleue their ſayenges.</p>
            <p>Here therfore lieth all the autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">The B. of Rome</note> of the biſhoppes of Rome, of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

and of the counſailes in the Duſt, which they holde them moſt chiefly by. For if they wolde obiecte the B. of Rome, as though men muſt nedes beleue him, bicauſe he is (w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to ambicious a name and title) called the head of the churche, yet ther is no cauſe why we ſhould be afrayd of hys autoritie.

            <p>Nother is ther any cauſe, why they <note place="margin">Counſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</note> ſhould vaunt of the canones of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes, and decrees of fathers: For the autoritie of them is ſpoken againſt, by this counſaile, which is the holieſt counſaill, that maye be hade or deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and the preſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and head of this counſail is the only begoten ſonne of God, and the eternal truthe of God: who hauing communicacion in the preſence of his welbeloued apoſtles, of the deceauours that ſhould com, in the later age of the worlde, commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Now let them hearken to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of fathers, let them beholde the Canones of counſailes, and make

            <p>Secondarily the Lorde warneth <note place="margin">Goo not furthe.</note> vs, that we goo not out, if they either teache a falſe Chriſt, or ſhewe Chriſt any wher elles, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Therfore it is very muche profitable for vs to knowe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing brethren in Chriſt) after what ſorte we may abide in the Lorde, and tary with him ſtill, vnto the ende: ſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cially ſeing we heare him ſaye.

We muſt nedes doo God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the heauenly fathers wil: Mary, what that is, we may knowe, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes of Chriſt him ſelf and the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>And furſt in dede, the Lorde him ſelf ſpeaketh of the will of the father, Io. 6. chap. and ſaithe: This is the wil <note place="margin">The will of God is that we beleue in his Sonne.</note> of him that ſent me, that al that ſee the ſonne, and beleue in him, haue euerlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting life.</p>
            <p>Therfore the will of God is good &amp; holſom vnto vs, which hathe this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ende, that we ſhall haue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſaluacion: but with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion, that we ſhould knowe the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:20007:184"/>
and beleue in him, whom he vouched<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſafe to ſende in to the worlde for our ſakes. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the furſt point of Goddes wil requireth of vs a very, a certain, a perfite, and an vnwauering faithe in Chriſt our Lorde &amp; ſaueour, to cleaue faſt vnto him withall, and to ſeke in him alone for thoſe thinges, that are neceſſary to com to eternal ſaluacion. And this faithe requireth a certain &amp; a perfite knowlage of Chriſt, to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that leaſt (while we make boaſt of our faithe) we carye in our hearte nothing but as it were, a bare and a vayne fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taſtical opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but we muſt beleue faithfully (and without al doub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting) thoſe thinges, that are ſet furthe vnto vs, in the worde of euerlaſting truthe, by Chriſt our Lorde.</p>
            <p>This worde deſcribeth our ſaueour <note place="margin">How the ſcriptures deſcribe Chriſt.</note> vnto vs, after this ſorte. Ieſus Chriſt is the true and natural ſonne of God the father, of all one ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, nature, &amp; maieſtie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerlaſting. And at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme appointed, he became ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our ſakes, not by laye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g awaye his godhead, but by receauing of Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, ſo that he which was God from euerlaſting, is now bothe very God &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:20007:185"/>
very ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in one inſeperable perſone. And foraſmuche as he became man, he ſuffred all thinges that a man may do, ſynne only except. For he was bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne as man, &amp; growed &amp; waxed ſtrong in body, ſtreynght, &amp; proceſſe of age. He was weary w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> trauaili<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, he reſted, &amp; he ſuffred bothe hongre &amp; thyrſt, he alſo wept for ſorowe of hearte. Yea he was afrayde of deathe, &amp; of the paynes of deathe, &amp; yet he abode them pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly &amp; ſtrongly, for our ſakes. But before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme of his deathe approched, his will was to haue his diuinitie knowen to men, not only by miracles &amp; wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſignes, but alſo opening the wil of his father, he gaue vs a certain, and an abſolute doctrine of ſaluacion and bleſſedneſſe. He choſed diſciples alſo, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after he had inſtructed them with his ſpirite, &amp; in the doctrine of the truthe, he might at his aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſende them furthe in to all the wyde worlde. And whan he dyed, he ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed his fathers righteouſneſſe by his deathe, and offring him ſelfe for vs once for all, he made a ſufficient ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the clenſyng of the ſynnes of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:20007:185"/>
the worlde. For by his deathe he brake the olde ſerpentes head, all to clattred his power, and toke his ſtreynght from hym, and than by his glorious reſurrection he ouercame deathe it ſelf. At laſt, whan he went vp in to heauen, he ſet heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gates wyde open for vs again, the which ſynne hade locked vs out of: and wolde haue the fleſhe which he toke of vs, to be the earneſt peny and pledge of our reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and ſaluacion in heauen. And now he ſitteth in heauen, and is our only and ſupreme biſhop: which as he offred his body a ſacrifice for our ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, euen ſo dothe he make interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for vs continually before our heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father, ſo as we (as muche endaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſynne as we are) may ſafely approche to the throne of grace.</p>
            <p>Such a maner Chriſt (I ſaye) and ſuche a maner ſaueour the oracles of the ſcripture purporte vnto vs: and the will of God the father is, that we ſtedfaſtly beleue him to be ſuch a one: and that we goo not about to ſeke any wher elles thoſe thinges, that are geuen vs in him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20007:186"/>
Now the faythe that we talke of, is not a certaine bare and a vayne fan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taſtical opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that conſiſteth in bare wordes and in nothing elles, but in the ſpeche of the mouthe: but it is a quicke lyuely ſtrong power, whiche beyng (by the ſpirite of God) graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed in mennes conſciences, contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all the hole mater of ſaluacion and religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For it is neceſſary for vs alſo, to know God the father, that we maye be truly and faythfully groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Ieſus Chriſt, Goddes owne ſonne. If we acknowlage him right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſuche a one as he is, we ſhall feare him alſo: and not that only, but alſo we ſhall loue him aboue all other thinges, &amp; beyng bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den to him with ſuche feare and loue, as children owe to their natural parentes, we ſhal wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lingly obeye him in al thinges.</p>
            <p>Out of the ſpowte of the ſame fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, ſhall ſpring what ſo euer can be required alſo, vnto externall religion. For in this faythe we ſhall not heare the ymaginacions of our owne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but haue reſpecte onlye vnto the doctrine and example of Chriſt, and depende holly of it. And whan we ſee,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:20007:186"/>
that he hathe ꝓuided ſo for his church, that he wolde not burthen it with an vnprofitable pompe of ceremonies, but (contenting him ſelf with a fewe) hath appointed only thoſe that myght be ſufficient vnto ſaluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt are, the preaching of the worde, baptiſme the token of regeneracion, and the Lordes ſupper, that acceptable remembraunce of the Lordes deathe, and of our redempcion.</p>
            <p>And ſo we contenting our ſelues alſo with thoſe ſame, wil thinke that nothing is to be added beſydes theſe, nother will we ſearche any deper, yf we wil beleue in him, &amp; acknowlage him to be our ſaueour, kyng &amp; prieſt, and the faythful ſcholemaiſter of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. As many therfore as diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly folowe this ſimple playne doctrine of Chriſt, and the oracles of Goddes worde, &amp; ſuffre not them ſelues to be drawen awaye w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes vaine ymaginacions, vnto them this fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full admonicion of Chriſt is both hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and profitable. But as many as will not haue their faythe and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hedged within theſe bondes, but leape ouer the hedge (lyke a wylde
<pb facs="tcp:20007:187"/>
beaſt) and iudge otherwyſe of Chriſt, than is taught in the ſcriptures: and ſeke ſaluacion and life elles wher, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Chriſt our only ſaueour: and alſo lade the churche with newe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and with a newe forme of religi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on: they forgette this faithfull admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicion, and doo contrary to Chriſtes commaundement goo out, and ſuffre them ſelues to be ſeduced, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the preſent dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger bothe of their owne ſoules and other folkes.</p>
            <p>And therfore I thinke al men may plainly ſee, what the cauſes are, that let vs, &amp; holde vs backe at this daye, that we can not for ſake either y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne truthe and Chriſt our Lorde, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com papiſtes, and ſubmitte our ſelues to the B. of Romes doctrine and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For the commaundement of Chriſt holdeth vs backe, which it wer not only abominable for vs to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, but alſo it is tyed vnto vs w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> extreme perile of our ſoules. And I thinke ther is no man ſo blynde, but he ſeeth, that the B of Romes doctrine is ſuch a one, that he pulleth awaye ſuche as folowe his trace w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them to goo out from Chriſt our

only ſaueour. For he ſpeaketh not of Chriſt, as the ſcriptures purporte. For his wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted maner is to ſhewe thoſe thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges which ar frely geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind by Chriſt alone, elles wher (yea in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>numerable) beſides chriſt.</p>
            <p>The B. of Rome reaſoneth of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (aſwell inwarde as outwarde) farre otherwiſe, than Chriſt did in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes paſt. He ſendeth men to ſayntes and pulleth them awaye from the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ker of all. He hathe brought a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſed muckeheape and burthen of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in to the churche, a great deale heauier than the leuitical prieſthood was, wherwith the vnlearned co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon peoples co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences are miſerably tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. Moreouer he teacheth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to buy thoſe thinges out with golde and ſiluer, that are frely geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs by Chriſt, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ought to be hade by only faith.

For Chriſt is that

king of glorie, the moſt victorious tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphaunt Emperour, &amp; that holy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Maieſtie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is mightie in dede, in whoſe ſight all knees ought to bowe.

            <p>Let vs now ſteppe ouer vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The wil of God is our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficacion.</note> chief point of Goddes will, which Paule in his. 1. Theſſa. 4. expoundeth on this wyſe: This is the will of God euen your ſanctificacion or holyneſſe, that you ſhould abſteine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hooredome, &amp; that euery one of you ſhould knowe, howe to poſſeſſe his veſſell wyth holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and honour, not wyth the luſte of concupiſcence, as the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do, whiche knowe not God.</p>
            <p>Here O you Romiſhe rufflers and moſte ſhameles papiſtes, lende me your eares a litel. You (I ſaye) that go about to bring the faythe in Chriſt, and the holy ſacred doctrine of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pelles truthe into ſlaunder &amp; hatred, vnder pretenſe as though it neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired good workes, but reiected and forbade them, as vnprofitable and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous. For where we aſcribe all
<pb facs="tcp:20007:189"/>
the glorie of our redempcion and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacion to Chriſt alone, and attribute nothing vnto your workes and meri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes, by and by ye burſt out in a great rage, and crye that we damne al good workes, and open a wyndowe for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to committe al wickedneſſe. But how falſely, how wickedly, how vnaduiſed<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, &amp; how ſhameleſſi ye doo this, learne it not of vs (whom ye hate already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hande) but of Paule the Apoſtle that choſen inſtrument of Chriſt our ſaueour. For albeit he dothe euery where harpe and beate vpon this one thing, that men ſhoulde knowe, they are ſaued by Ieſus Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth alſo with playne wordes, that he knoweth nothing elles ſaue Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; that he was crucified: yet he ſaieth not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good worckes are eyther vnprofitable or ſuꝑfluous, nor biddeth men folowe the luſt &amp; the ſynful affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their owne fleſhe, nother doth he appoynt ſuche a faythe, as maye make men to ſynne careleſly, as theſe wicked, blaſphemous, &amp; antichriſtian Papiſtes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude. But this (ſayeth he) is the wyl of God, euen your holyneſſe.</p>
            <p>For ſeyng Chriſt Ieſus hathe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:20007:189"/>
vs wyth his owne blood, and ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified vs, and made vs the temples of his ſpirite, the apoſtle wold haue vs to be after ſuch ſorte, that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynue ſtil in this ſanctificacion or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe, and not defile our ſelues wyth the filthineſſe of ſynnes. And for that cauſe, he maketh mencion of hooredome moſt chiefly in this place, bicauſe the hooremonger vnhaloweth that holy ſacred temple, moſt ſpecially in ſynnyng againſt his owne body: yet vnder the name of hooredome, he will haue vs vnderſtande all vnclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that man is ſpotted wythall. For he ſaith moreouer: That euery one of you knowe, how to poſſeſſe his veſſell, that is, his bodye with holyneſſe and honour: I meane, ſo as the name of God may be ſanctified and halow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vs, and in our conuerſacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not to lyue like the heathens, which are moſt farre from the knowlage of God. But this ſanctificacion or holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is the frute of faithe, yea ſuch a frute, that faithe can not poſſibly be wythout it. For yf thow doeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, that thow art redemed from the tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nye of ſynne, and from the fire of
<pb facs="tcp:20007:190"/>
damnacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bitter deathe &amp; moſt painfull ſorowes of Chriſt, and haſte this only hope of thy ſaluacion &amp; life: ſuerly thow wilt not caſt awaye nor ſet ſo light by this thy ſaluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is redemed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo deare a price by the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thow wilt loſe it, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pleaſures of thy carnall affectiones, which ſhal vaniſhe away eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides this, if thow haſt put on Ieſus Chriſt truly by faithe, thow wilt not ſoile him, that is ſo noble a garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; of more value tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of golde &amp; precious ſtones, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> filthie workes of ſynnes: but though thow be ouercome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; fall through the frailtie of mannes nature, yet thow wilt vp agayne quickly, &amp; bewaile thy fall bitterly. And for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res ſaye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> faithe is the good tree, that can not bring furthe euil frutes. For inaſmuche as faithe is the worke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſpirit of God, it muſt nedes alſo bring furthe the frutes of the ſpirite: double loue, that is, of God, and a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Therfore we learne by this (bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren)
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:20007:190"/>
furſt that they are moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal blaſphemers againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true faithe and religion, that is buylded vpon Chriſt alone, as many as ſaye, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of the goſpel is an enemie to good workes: ſecondly, that they truly abyde in Chriſt, and cleaue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly vnto him, that boaſte of their faithe, not only in their wordes, and bragge not in the only ſpeaking of faithe, but geue them ſelues vnto holyneſſe of life, and applye them ſelues to this ende only, that they may kepe their veſſell (which is waſhed with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood of Chriſt) pure &amp; cleane. For he can not be called a membre or a diſciple of Chriſt, which forgetteth chriſtian pureneſſe and holineſſe, and maketh him ſelf the bonde ſlaue of ſynne, and an inſtrument for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil to pype in. Therfore in this admonici<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſail of our ſaueour Chriſt, is ſecretly compriſed that true &amp; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall lawe, and vnfailing rule, that he wolde haue common to al his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and with ſingular forſight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth them to frame their life and religion according to this rule: Mary it is a prety ſhorte rule, a plain rule &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:20007:191"/>
eaſie to be perceaued. For he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs, not to beleue them, that either ſhewe a falſe Chriſt, or teache vs to ſeke Chriſt him ſelf and the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that are geuen vs by his merite, in any place elles: but to ſticke faſt to the ſcriptures, and not to ſtarte fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them one ynche, but in all thinges that perteyne either to God him ſelf, or to the ſeruice of God, he biddeth vs haunt thoſe thinges, with a conſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and vnwauering faithe, in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and in pureneſſe and innocencie of life, that we be taught in the holy ſcriptures to doo.</p>
            <p>Vnto this rule it is neceſſary, that al the conſtitucions and rules of mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, chanones, friers, and nonnes geue place, which they are toto proude of in the papacie. For who ſo euer they be that walke according to this rule (as Paule ſaithe) peace and mercie be <note place="margin">

And contrary wiſe they ſhal one daye fele, that they haue gone to farre out of the waye, as many as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidre not ſo faithfull a monicionar, and deuiſe an other rule of life and faithe for them ſelues to folowe.</p>

Now are we come to the thrid <note place="margin">Of the lor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des laſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> and laſt ſpeciall point of this admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicion, wher in Chriſt maketh playne mencion of his laſt commyng. Furſt he teacheth vs, in what ſorte, forme, facion, and glorious royaltie he ſhall come: and than he expoundeth the condicion and ſtate of the ſayntes and faithfull people, which they ſhall receaue at the tyme of the laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Concerning the furſt, he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth theſe wordes. As the lightenyng gothe from the eaſt and ſhyneth to the weſt, ſo ſhal the commyng of the ſonne of man be.</p>
            <p>Here we are taught (brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) that the Lorde ſhall com at a ſodayn cheoppe, like lightenyng: and at ſuch a tyme as men ſhall thinke, that (of all other tymes) they are like than to haue moſt peace, ſecuritie, and worldly wealthe. For ſo dothe Paule in his furſt epiſtle to the Theſſalonianes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de Chriſtes wordes, ſayeng: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the tymes and ſeaſones (bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) I nede not to write vnto you. For you knowe plainly, that the daye of the Lorde ſhal come like a thefe in the
<pb facs="tcp:20007:192"/>
night. For whan they ſhall ſaye, peace, and all thing is cocke ſure, than hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ouer them ſodayn deſtruction, like the trauaile of a woman labouring of childe, and they ſhall not eſcape it.</p>
            <p>Theſe wordes are ſpoken and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to this ende (brethren) to ſtere vs vp, to watche and prepare our ſelues, that we may be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de ready like thrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye ſeruauntes at the Lordes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng. Moreouer the Lorde vſeth alſo the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of lightenyng, to ſhewe the maner and facion of his commyng. And therby he geueth warnyng, that he wil not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me in a poore eſtate, baſſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, nor as a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned perſone, or like a caſt awaye, as he was whan he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the fleſhe, whan he ſpake theſe wordes: but with a mightie trayne in great ſhynyng brighteneſſe, glorie, po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wer, and maieſtie, ſo as all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhall tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble and ſhake for feare, at the ſight of it.</p>

His throne was like the fyrie flame, and his wheles as the burnyng fire. Ther drewe furthe a fyrie ſtreame, and went out from him. A thouſaunt tymes a M. ſerued him, ten thouſaunt times .X. M. ſtode before him &amp;c. And the Lorde ſpeaketh like vnto theſe wordes. Matth. 25. Whan the ſonne of man ſhall come in his glorie, &amp; al his angels w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal he ſitte vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſeate of his glorie, &amp; al nacions ſhal be gathered together before hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. &amp;c. Howbeit theſe are written (brethren) not as though the Lorde wold make vs afraide, like a tyranne, but that we ſhould print theſe wordes in our myndes, and frame all our life after ſuch ſorte, that at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame his glorious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, we may be able to ſtande ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely before his righteous and drede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful iudgement. For we ſhal haue him to be our iudge, that can nother be frayde with the glorie and power of the worlde, nor be entreated by any noble blood, nother yet brybed with worldly richeſſe. But the thing that
<pb facs="tcp:20007:193"/>
he only regardeth and rewardeth, is faithe working by charitie. Gal. 5.</p>
            <p>The ſeconde thing that the Lorde ſpeaketh of in this laſt chief point of his admonicion, is that he teacheth <note place="margin">The ſtate of the faithful at the Lordes commyng.</note> vs, what the condicion (or ſtate) of his people ſhal be at this his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng and glorious iudgement. For it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a harde and a fearfull mater to the fleſhe, whan it heareth, that al the pleaſures of this worlde, wherin it only delyteth, ſhall periſhe once, and that all we ſhal be preſented before ſo mighty a iudge.</p>
            <p>But it is full of comforte, that the Lorde ſpeaketh here: For where ſo euer (ſaithe he) the carcaſſe is, ther alſo ſhal the eagles reſorte, or be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Here he compareth the faithfull people vnto eagles, and him ſelf vnto y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meate, wherunto they flye. For like as the eagles with their high flyeng mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te vp to the cloudes, &amp; (w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyte) beholde the brighteneſſe of the ſunne (y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhyning beames wherof non other lyuing creature is hable to loke directly vpon) euen ſo thoſe that be faithfull people being caried with the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:20007:193"/>
wynges of faithe aboue all the cares of this worlde, lifte vp their heartes to heauen, wher their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſacion is, and their right citie that euer ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: &amp; ſo with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eyes of their mynde, they beholde the ſunne of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe Ieſus Chriſt, which is our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and the only quickenyng meate of the faithfull. For he is the bread of life, which being eaten by faithe, fedeth vs vnto life euerlaſting. And Chriſt ſaithe, that theſe eagles, that is, the faithful people ſhal reſorte vnto him: ſo that they ſhal be gathered to him as it were in one moment, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well thoſe that were departed afore in the true faithe, as thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde at his commyng ſhall fynde prepared and ready in faith. For thus dothe Paule 1 Theſſa. 4. expounde Chriſtes wordes. This we ſaye vnto you in the worde of the Lorde, that we which lyue, and are remayning in the commyng of the Lorde, ſhall not com ere they which ſlepe. For the Lorde him ſelfe ſhall deſcende from heauen wyth a ſhowte, and the voice of the archangel and trompe of God. And the dead in Chriſt ſhall aryſe furſt, than ſhall we
<pb facs="tcp:20007:194"/>
which lyue and remayne, be caught vp with them alſo in the clowdes, to mete the Lorde in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ayer. And ſo ſhal we euer be with the Lorde. Wherfore comforte your ſelues, one an other, with theſe wordes.</p>
            <p>Marke (louing brethren) how ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, howe pleaſaunt, and howe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable thoſe ſayenges be, that are ſpecified in the ſcriptures, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the glorious comming of Chriſt vnto iudgement. But if we luſt to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arken to the papiſtes in this behalfe, they will tell vs ſuch tales, as are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not only to dryue mennes conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in to feare and drede, but alſo in to flatte deſperacion. For they haue forged horrible and cruell tokens, by the rehearſal wherof they haue ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the rude people of all comfortable reioyceing, and haue fraide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt pitifully. But the ſpirite of our ſaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt ſpeaking by the apoſtles, maketh ſo playne mencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as that which made vs afraide, whan we wandred in the darkeneſſe of popery, is now ioye &amp; myrthe vnto vs, ſo that with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual prayers and feruent deſires, we loke for the Lorde,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:20007:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and wold fayne haue his commyng to drawe nere. For how great &amp; how honourable ſhal the ſayntes glorie be, whan thoſe that were dead and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in to earthe and duſte, ſhall ryſe again with clarified bodies, and ſhall lyue and be tranſformed in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and al the nature of corrupcion and what ſo euer hade ben corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and mortal, infirme, and ſubiecte to ſorowes in them, they ſhall put of: and by and by they ſhal be coupled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their ſpouſe Chriſt, and be caried with him vnto the eternall glorie of true bleſſedneſſe? Than I ſaye, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eagles ſhall continually beholde their ſunne of righteouſnes for euer, and ſhal be fedde with the meate of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, ſo that they ſhall neuer fele hongre.</p>
            <p>And contrary wiſe, that bloody and cruel curſed generacion of raue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and grypes, I meane the wicked tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; enemies of his churche, which in this worlde perſecuted the Lordes ſaintes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fire &amp; ſweorde, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al kinde of merciles crueltie: &amp; all beaſtly bely cheare myniones (men geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their paunche and hooriſhe luſtes) ſhal be
